	abstract = {Controlled quantum mechanical motion of trapped atomic ions can be used to simulate and explore collective quantum phenomena and to process quantum information. Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into "Coulomb crystals" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 \$μ\$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.},

The sensor array is consisted of four groups of sensors and the nominal wavelength of the sensors in the same group is different. The {SOA} is driven by a pulse generator which switch on the {SOA} at different periods, as a switch to select the reflected pulses from a particular group. Using low reflectivity (3\%{\textasciitilde}5\%) sensors the number of the groups can achieved 50, the bandwidth of each group used in this system is 40 nm (1525-1565nm), the system permits the interrogation of up to 1000 {FBG} sensors. With this technique, the {FBG} sensors system avoid using optical switch to expand channels, it improved the response speed and reduced cost in the application of structural health monitoring where large numbers of sensors are required.},

We then compare this sensitivity limit to several spectrometer types and dim light sources of interest, such as, spontaneous parametric downconversion, Raman scattering, and spontaneous four-wave mixing.

Multiple interferometric signals from the same beam path can thereby be isolated based on their propagation delay, allowing one to use advantageous optical layouts in comparison to classic laser interferometers. We present here a high speed version of this technique for measuring multiple targets spatially separated by only a few centimetres. This allows measurements of multiplexed signals using free beams, making the technique attractive for several applications requiring compact optical set-ups like for example space-based interferometers. In an experiment using a modulation and sampling rate of 1.25 {GHz} we are able to demonstrate multiplexing between targets only separated by 36 cm and we achieve a displacement measurement noise floor of \&lt;3 pm/Hz at 10 Hz between them. We identify a limiting excess noise at low frequencies which is unique to this technique and is probably caused by the finite bandwidth in our measurement set-up. Utilising an active clock jitter correction scheme we are also able to reduce this noise in a null measurement configuration by one order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Fast and accurate 3D position detection in optical tweezers ({OT}) is essential for quantitatively monitoring subtle variations in the mechanical properties of microscopic systems ranging from biomolecules to cells and colloids. Because standard {OT} configurations do not provide direct access to the axial position, axial detection typically relies on temporal fluctuations in forward-scattered optical power to infer the position of the particle. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, leading to deviations from the linear response. Here, we present a simple yet comprehensive model for axial detection in standard {OT} while explicitly accounting for the backward-scattered field. Together with experimental validation, this framework neatly explains the standing-wave response observed when the backward-scattered field interferes with the nonscattered and the forward-scattered components, enabling accurate estimation of trap stiffness and particle diffusion under more general conditions. This work deepens our understanding of the phenomenology observed in real optical-tweezers measurements and extends their capabilities to conditions where standard approaches fail.},

This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode.

This component of the Poynting momentum was previously thought to be virtual, and unmeasurable. Here, its effect is revealed in the inertial motion of a probe particle in a circularly polarized Gaussian trap, in vacuum. Transverse spin forces combine with thermal fluctuations to induce a striking range of non-equilibrium phenomena. With increasing beam power we observe (i) growing departures from energy equipartition, (ii) the formation of coherent, thermally excited orbits and, ultimately, (iii) the ejection of the particle from the trap. As well as corroborating existing measurements of spin momentum, our results reveal its dynamic effect. We show how the under-damped motion of probe particles in structured light fields can expose the nature and morphology of optical momentum flows, and provide a testbed for elementary non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.},

	abstract = {We theoretically consider orbital rotation of a spheroidal submicron particle in the field of two counter-propagating circularly polarized Gaussian beams. We derived equations connecting the parameters of the circular orbits centered on the beams axis to the optical force and torque. The equations show that, besides orbital rotation, the spheroidal particle simultaneously rotates around its equatorial axis. We found that two distinct dynamic regimes are possible. The orbital motion can be accompanied by a rapid proper rotation with angular velocity an order of magnitude larger than the angular velocity of the orbital rotation. Alternatively, the orbital and proper rotations can be synchronized. The direction of orbital rotation can either coincide with or be opposite to the direction of rotation of the electric vector. The findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations. The results can be of use in development of nano-scale gyroscopes as well in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles.},

	abstract = {A multi-channel time division multiplexing anti-aliasing filter is designed for the aliasing of digital signals in a networked airborne acquisition system applied to flight tests, and adopts an anti-aliasing filter with variable sampling rate. In the digital signal processing process, due to the high sampling rate, digital signal aliasing may occur during integer multiple extraction, which solves the problem that digital signal aliasing may occur when performing integer multiple extraction in the digital signal processing process due to the high sampling rate. Digital filter is realized by {FPGA}, which realizes multi-channel time division multiplexing function and supports digital signal processing of 8 channels of synchronous sampling data. The filter characteristic test is performed on the system. For the original signal of 8 {kHz}, the cutoff frequency of the half-band filter is Fs/4, that is, 2 {kHz}, the signal frequency corresponding to -3 {dB} after the system is 2048 Hz. The amplitude-frequency characteristic curve of the system is consistent with the {MATLAB} simulation results.},

However, it also introduces at least a 3 {dB} penalty to the shot-noise limited phase sensitivity when compared to that attainable through homodyne detection. In this paper, we show theoretically that this penalty can be lifted by implementing detection and demodulation schemes that exploit the cyclostationary nature of shot noise observed at the outputs of the self-heterodyne interferometer. We also discuss how expected departures from ideality, namely imperfect interferometric visibility, non-zero stationary noise, and finite detection bandwidth, affect the performance of these schemes and propose a simplified procedure relaxing the requirement for a rigorous instrument characterization. While two independent detectors are required to reach the true (classical-light) shot-noise limit for phase, single-detector instruments can also benefit from the introduced ideas to achieve up to 3 {dB} improvement in phase sensitivity.},

An important factor that can limit the performance is the relative power instability of the laser, a problem often called relative intensity noise ({RIN}). But exactly how this influences the interferometer performance is not completely understood. Therefore in this paper we analyze laser {RIN} coupling into the phase readout in balanced and unbalanced heterodyne interferometers. We describe the coupling theoretically, then simulate and finally measure it. Our results reveal a combination of {RIN} contributions from the heterodyne frequency and twice the heterodyne frequency in the interferometric phase readout. We also show that when an additional, correlated reference measurement is subtracted the combined coupling factor depends on the differential phase between the two measurements and thus can be minimized. Our results have implications for noise models in future space-based gravitational wave observatories like Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, where {RIN}-to-phase coupling arises directly and is modulated via spacecraft jitter, testmass position and orientation.},

However, in space missions in particular, such as {LISA} Pathfinder or {LISA}, direct measurements of these fluctuations at the relevant frequencies are often not available. Hence, it can be challenging to estimate their impact on the interference phase. To address this, we propose a new method for characterizing laser relative intensity noise ({RIN}) using differential wavefront sensing ({DWS}), with the latter being a well-established technique typically used for angular sensing and control. Unlike other methods, this approach does not require an additional reference interferometer and instead takes advantage of the inherent phase subtraction of {DWS}. This allows us to estimate the {RIN} value at the heterodyne frequency and its harmonic, relative to the sensor noise floor of the total measurement system. Moreover, it provides a strategy to identify the ideal set point for minimizing {RIN} couplings in {DWS}.},

	abstract = {Achieving spatiotemporal control of light at subwavelength and subcycle scales is an important milestone in the development of new photonic materials and technologies. Ultrafast spatiotemporal light modulation currently relies on electronic interband and intraband transitions that yield pronounced refractive index changes but typically suffer from slow, picosecond response times due to carrier relaxation. Here we show that by leveraging resonant light-matter interactions in a high-quality factor metasurface it is possible to use the optical Kerr effect, a weaker, but instantaneous optoelectronic polarization effect, to achieve ultrafast, reconfigurable light modulation with unprecedented spatial and temporal control. By the subwavelength all-optical tuning of the refractive index of the dielectric metasurface unit cells, we experimentally demonstrate pulse-limited beam steering with a 74-fs response time at angles up to \${\textbackslash}pm \$13° in the near-infrared. The steering originates from the Kerr effect with a background contribution arising from slower two-photon-excited free carrier absorption. Additionally, we observe spatial back-action, linear frequency conversion, and demonstrate arbitrary ultrafast spatial light modulation in two dimensions. Our findings open the possibility of realizing new ultrafast physics in metastructures with applications in signal processing, pulse shaping, and ultrafast imaging.},

In conventional {QCCD} architectures, each trap electrode is controlled via a dedicated digital-to-analog converter ({DAC}). The conventional approach places an overwhelming demand on electronic resources and wiring complexity. This is because the number of trap electrodes typically exceeds the number of trapped-ion qubits. This study proposes a method that leverages a high-speed {DAC} to generate time-division multiplexed signals to control a large-scale {QCCD} trapped-ion quantum processor. The proposed method replaces conventional {DACs} with a single high-speed {DAC} that generates the complete voltage waveforms required to control the trap electrodes, thereby significantly reducing the wiring complexity and overall resource requirements. Based on realistic parameters and commercially available electronics, our analysis demonstrates that a {QCCD} trapped-ion quantum computer with 10,000 trap electrodes can be controlled using only 13 field-programmable gate arrays and 104 high-speed {DACs}. This is in stark contrast to the 10,000 dedicated {DACs} required by conventional control methods.

	abstract = {We characterized experimental artifacts arising from the non-linear response of acousto-optical deflectors ({AODs}) in an ultra-fast force-clamp optical trap and have shown that using electro-optical deflectors ({EODs}) instead eliminates these artifacts. We give an example of the effects of these artifacts in our ultra-fast force clamp studies of the interaction of myosin with actin filaments. The experimental setup, based on the concept of Capitanio et al. [Nat. Methods 9, 1013\&\#x2013;1019 (2012)] utilizes a bead-actin-bead dumbbell held in two force-clamped optical traps which apply a load to the dumbbell to move it at a constant velocity. When myosin binds to actin, the filament motion stops quickly as the total force from the optical traps is transferred to the actomyosin attachment. We found that in our setup, {AODs} were unsuitable for beam steering due to non-linear variations in beam intensity and deflection angle as a function of driving frequency, likely caused by low-amplitude standing acoustic waves in the deflectors. These aberrations caused instability in the force feedback loops leading to artifactual jumps in the trap position. We demonstrate that beam steering with {EODs} improves the performance of our instrument. Combining the superior beam-steering capability of the {EODs}, force acquisition via back-focal-plane interferometry, and dual high-speed {FPGA}-based feedback loops, we apply precise and constant loads to study the dynamics of interactions between actin and myosin. The same concept applies to studies of other biomolecular interactions.},

	abstract = {Neuromorphic cameras are a new class of dynamic-vision-inspired sensors that encode the rate of change of intensity as events. They can asynchronously record intensity changes as spikes, independent of the other pixels in the receptive field, resulting in sparse measurements. This recording of such sparse events makes them ideal for imaging dynamic processes, such as the stochastic emission of isolated single molecules. Here we show the application of neuromorphic detection to localize nanoscale fluorescent objects below the diffraction limit, with a precision below 20 nm. We demonstrate a combination of neuromorphic detection with segmentation and deep learning approaches to localize and track fluorescent particles below 50 nm with millisecond temporal resolution. Furthermore, we show that combining information from events resulting from the rate of change of intensities improves the classical limit of centroid estimation of single fluorescent objects by nearly a factor of two. Additionally, we validate that using post-processed data from the neuromorphic detector at defined windows of temporal integration allows a better evaluation of the fractalized diffusion of single particle trajectories. Our observations and analysis is useful for event sensing by nonlinear neuromorphic devices to ameliorate real-time particle localization approaches at the nanoscale.},

By introducing artificial sway into the sensor plane with a steering mirror, we significantly increase the event recording rate, thereby improving the spatiotemporal resolution of the tracked particles. From the spatial distribution of detected events, we identify the positions of isolated particles without prior knowledge of their shapes, bypassing the limitations of tracking algorithms based on particle centroids. In our experiment, we modulated the mirror at 1 {kHz}, achieving up to a 400-fold enhancement in temporal resolution. To test our method, we characterize the Brownian motion of a microparticle by calculating the variance of its position and estimating the diffusion coefficient of the medium at various temperatures through the mean-square displacement calculation. Using permutation entropy, we confirm that our modulation does not affect the stochastic nature of the particle movement.},

By applying controlled precessive torques to the dipole moment of a levitated microsphere in vacuum, we demonstrate cancellation of dipole-induced backgrounds by 2 orders of magnitude. We measure the dipole moments of nanogram-mass spheres and determine their scaling with sphere size, finding that the dominant torques arise from induced dipole moments related to dielectric-loss properties of the {SiO}2 spheres.

Observation of a change in the net charge of the particle coincident with the recoil allows decays to be identified with background levels at the micro-Becquerel level.

Although atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation17–22 could substantially enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology23 and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction24,25. Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate reloading and continuous operation of a large-scale atom-array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than 2 hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits.

Many of these interactions manifest as momentum kicks, such as the recoil of residual gas, radioactive decay, or even hypothetical interactions with dark matter. These disturbances are often rare enough that they can be resolved as singular events rather than cumulated as force noise. While high-𝑄 resonators with low masses are particularly sensitive to such momentum kicks, they will strongly excite the resonator, leading to nonlinear effects that deteriorate sensing performance. Hence, this paper utilizes optimal estimation methods to extract individual momentum kicks from measured stochastic trajectories of a mechanical resonator kept in the linear regime through feedback control. The developed scheme is illustrated and tested experimentally using a prestressed silicon nitride trampoline resonator. Apart from enhancing a wide range of sensing scenarios mentioned above, our results indicate the feasibility of novel single-molecule mass spectrometry approaches.},

	abstract = {A mechanically compliant element can be set into motion by the interaction with light. In turn, this light-driven motion can give rise to ponderomotive correlations in the electromagnetic field. In optomechanical systems, cavities are often employed to enhance these correlations up to the point where they generate quantum squeezing of light. In free-space scenarios, where no cavity is used, observation of squeezing remains possible but challenging due to the weakness of the interaction, and has not been reported so far. Here, we measure the ponderomotively squeezed state of light scattered by a nanoparticle levitated in a free-space optical tweezer. We observe a reduction of the optical fluctuations by up to 25\% below the vacuum level, in a bandwidth of about 15 {kHz}. Our results are explained well by a linearized dipole interaction between the nanoparticle and the electromagnetic continuum. These ponderomotive correlations open the door to quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology with levitated systems, such as force measurements below the standard quantum limit.},

For many sensing applications, extending these techniques to arrays of sensors enables rejection of correlated noise sources and increases sensitivity to interactions that may be too rare or weak to detect with a single particle. Here we present techniques capable of trapping defect-free, two-dimensional arrays of more than 25 microspheres in vacuum. These techniques provide independent control of the optical potential for each sphere. Simultaneous imaging of the motion of all spheres in the array is demonstrated using camera-based imaging, with optimized object tracking algorithms reaching a displacement sensitivity below 1 nm/√Hz. Such arrays of levitated microspheres may find applications ranging from inertial sensing to searches for weakly interacting particles such as dark matter.},

The advantages of using microspheres in applications such as drug delivery, bone tissue engineering and regeneration, absorption and desorption of substances, kinetic release of the loaded drug components are also presented. This review also reports on the preparation and characterisation methodologies used for the manufacture of these microspheres. Finally, a brief summary of the existing challenges associated with processing these microspheres which requires further research and development are presented.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of {keV}-scale sterile neutrino Dark Matter, collecting views and insights from all disciplines involved – cosmology, astrophysics, nuclear, and particle physics – in each case viewed from both theoretical and experimental/observational perspectives. After reviewing the role of active neutrinos in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, we focus on sterile neutrinos in the context of the Dark Matter puzzle. Here, we ﬁrst review the physics motivation for sterile neutrino Dark Matter, based on challenges and tensions in purely cold Dark Matter scenarios. We then round out the discussion by critically summarizing all known constraints on sterile neutrino Dark Matter arising from astrophysical observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical considerations. In this context, we provide a balanced discourse on the possibly positive signal from X-ray observations. Another focus of the paper concerns the construction of particle physics models, aiming to explain how sterile neutrinos of {keV}-scale masses could arise in concrete settings beyond the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. The paper ends with an extensive review of current and future astrophysical and laboratory searches, highlighting new ideas and their experimental challenges, as well as future perspectives for the discovery of sterile neutrinos.},

	abstract = {We describe a project that brings together researchers from atomic physics, nuclear physics and sub-atomic particle physics, to develop a high-precision laboratory-scale experiment able to search for very weakly coupled sterile neutrinos in the mass range extending from 5–10 {keV}/c 2 to several 100 {keV}/c 2. Observed neutrino flavor eigenstates are known to be quantum mixtures of at least three sub-{eV}/c 2 mass eigenstates. There is a strong theoretical belief that there may exist further neutrino mass eigenstates at higher mass levels, and which, if in the {keV}/c 2 mass range, might form all or part of the galactic dark matter. This has led to many searches for anomalous events in both astrophysical and particle physics experiments, and searches for distortions in beta decay spectra. The present experiment will utilize K-capture events in a population of 131Cs atoms suspended in vacuum by a magneto-optical trap ({MOT}). Using {AMO} and nuclear physics techniques, individual events will be fully reconstructed kinematically. Normally each event would be consistent with an emitted neutrino mass close to zero, but the existence of a sterile neutrino of {keV}/c 2 mass that mixes with the electron type neutrino produced in the decay would result in a separated population of events with non-zero reconstructed missing mass (up to the Q = 352 {keV} available energy of the reaction). Detailed calculations and simulations of all significant background processes have been made, in particular for scattering in the source itself, radiative K-capture, local radioactivity, cosmic ray muons, and knock-out of electrons by x-rays. A phase 1 of the experiment, under construction with funding from the W M Keck Foundation, has the potential to reach sterile neutrino mixing angles down to sin2 θ ∼ 10−4. With further upgrades this technique could be progressively improved to eventually reach much lower coupling levels ∼10−10, in particular reaching the level needed to be consistent with galactic dark matter below the astrophysical x-ray limits.},

We study in detail these two types of damping effects using reactor neutrino experiments and experiments with radioactive \${\textasciicircum}\{51\}\$Cr source as examples. We demonstrate that the effects of decoherence by {WP} separation can always be incorporated into a modification of the energy resolution function of the detector and so are intimately entangled with it. We estimate for the first time the lengths \${\textbackslash}sigma\_x\$ of {WPs} of reactor neutrinos and neutrinos from a radioactive \${\textasciicircum}\{51\}\$Cr source. The obtained values, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_x = (2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\} - 1.4{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\})\$ cm, are at least six orders of magnitude larger than the currently available experimental lower bounds.

In this review article, we discuss the theoretical and experimental motivation for sterile neutrinos, as well as their phenomenological consequences. With the benefit of hindsight in 2020, we point out potentially viable and interesting ideas. We focus in particular on sterile neutrinos that are light enough to participate in neutrino oscillations, but we also comment on the benefits of introducing heavier sterile states. We discuss the phenomenology of {eV}-scale sterile neutrinos in terrestrial experiments and in cosmology, we survey the global data, and we highlight various intriguing anomalies. We also expose the severe tension that exists between different data sets and prevents a consistent interpretation of the global data in at least the simplest sterile neutrino models. We discuss non-minimal scenarios that may alleviate some of this tension. We briefly review the status of {keV}-scale sterile neutrinos as dark matter and the possibility of explaining the matter–antimatter asymmetry of the Universe through leptogenesis driven by yet heavier sterile neutrinos.},

	abstract = {Sterile neutrinos in the {keV} mass range may constitute the galactic dark matter. Various proposed direct detection and laboratory searches are summarized. It is suggested that a promising method for searching for {keV} sterile neutrinos in the laboratory is complete energy-momentum reconstruction of individual beta-decay or K-capture events, by measuring the vector momentum of all decay products from atoms suspended in a magneto-optical trap. Reconstruction of the ‘missing mass’ would isolate any {keV}-range sterile neutrinos as a separated population. A survey of suitable nuclides is presented, together with the measurement precision required in a typical experimental configuration. Among the most promising are the K-capture nuclides 131Cs, which requires measurement of an x-ray and several Auger electrons in addition to the atomic recoil, and 7Be which has only a single decay product but needs development work to achieve a trapped source. A number of background effects are discussed. It is concluded that, with current time-of-flight precision, sterile neutrinos with masses down to the 10 {keV} region would be detectable with relative couplings 10−5–10−6 in a 1–2 year running time, and with foreseeable future upgrades eventually able to reach coupling levels down to 10−10–10−11 using high-population trapped sources.},

Similarly to the case of linear Fourier modes evolving independently under the action of chromatic dispersion alone, {NFT}-based systems employ so-called “nonlinear modes,” forming a nonlinear spectrum, as data carriers, and these nonlinear modes evolve independently in an uncoupled manner under the joint action of nonlinearity and dispersion. However, the influence of amplified-spontaneous-emission ({ASE}) noise on these nonlinear modes is still relatively poorly studied. In this paper, dealing with a continuous nonlinear spectrum, we scrutinize the properties of the effective noise emerging in the nonlinear Fourier domain. We also show that in the transmission stages, where the signal peak power is relatively high (e.g., at the receiver, in back-to-back transmission, or at short distances), the performance of an {NFT} system is mostly degraded not by the inline {ASE} noise, but by the imperfections of the digital sampling and the forward and backward {NFT} algorithms, i.e., by the {NFT} processing noise.},

It is becoming clear, however, that thermal relaxation is much more intricate when temperature changes push the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, by using an optically trapped colloidal particle, we show that microscale systems under such conditions heat up faster than they cool down. We find that between any pair of temperatures, heating is not only faster than cooling but the respective processes, in fact, evolve along fundamentally distinct pathways, which we explain with a new theoretical framework that we call thermal kinematics. Our results change the view of thermalization at the microscale and will have a strong impact on energy-conversion applications and thermal management of microscopic devices, particularly in the operation of Brownian heat engines.},

Raabe built and analysed the first time-division multiplex system for telephony, a task that required of him a thorough understanding of sampling, including sampling with pulses of finite duration and sampling of low-pass and band-pass signals. We analyse his approach, its significance from the viewpoint of sampling, the generality of its conclusions, and also the milieu that lead to his remarkable achievements: the exceptional research climate existing in Berlin at the time he worked. We also examine the connection between “Raabe's condition”, the work of Harry Nyquist (1924, 1928) on telegraphy and the so-called “Nyquist rate”.

We also demonstrate the ability of using the inherent directional sensitivity of these sensors to separate possible dark matter signals from backgrounds. Future extensions of the techniques developed here can enable searches for light dark matter and massive neutrinos that can reach sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing searches.},

	abstract = {The most obvious method for determining the distortion of telegraph signals is to calculate the transients of the telegraph system. This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Neuromorphic cameras are a new class of dynamic-vision-inspired sensors that encode the rate of change of intensity as events. They can asynchronously record intensity changes as spikes, independent of the other pixels in the receptive field, resulting in sparse measurements. This recording of such sparse events makes them ideal for imaging dynamic processes, such as the stochastic emission of isolated single molecules. Here we show the application of neuromorphic detection to localize nanoscale fluorescent objects below the diffraction limit, with a precision below 20 nm. We demonstrate a combination of neuromorphic detection with segmentation and deep learning approaches to localize and track fluorescent particles below 50 nm with millisecond temporal resolution. Furthermore, we show that combining information from events resulting from the rate of change of intensities improves the classical limit of centroid estimation of single fluorescent objects by nearly a factor of two. Additionally, we validate that using post-processed data from the neuromorphic detector at defined windows of temporal integration allows a better evaluation of the fractalized diffusion of single particle trajectories. Our observations and analysis is useful for event sensing by nonlinear neuromorphic devices to ameliorate real-time particle localization approaches at the nanoscale.},

This paper provides an overview of the {TDM} technology and its status when viewed in light of the key flight control system requirements.

Here we analyze the dependence of dynamic range on carrier frequency and repetition frequency in a time-division-multiplexing ({TDM}) {IFOS} array using a heterodyne detection scheme. A novel, to the best of our knowledge, demodulation method with higher carrier frequency and an upgraded algorithm is proposed to improve the dynamic range. In the simulation and experiment, the carrier frequency was increased from 50 {kHz} to 20 {MHz}, and the demodulation method was adjusted correspondingly. The maximum detectable phase amplitude is elevated by more than 6 {dB} as the theoretical expectation, and the demodulated noise floor is proven to be barely influenced, holding at ∼−100 {dB} ref rad/      		  H	  z	          . Experimental results demonstrate that the average dynamic range over 10 Hz to 20 {kHz} is enhanced by approximately 10.5 {dB}.

While multiple pore-based resistive pulse sensors are preferred to increase the analysis throughput and to overcome the clogging issues, the scalability is often limited. In response, by combining the time-division multiple access technique in the telecommunication ﬁeld with the microﬂuidics, we reported a microﬂuidic time-division multiplexing accessing ({TDMA}) singleend resistive pulse sensor, in which particles can be analyzed through a scalable number of microﬂuidic channels. With an eight-channel microﬂuidic device and polystyrene particles as proof-of-principle, we successfully demonstrated this multiplexed technology is eﬀective in measuring the particle size and concentration, in analyzing the particle arriving dynamics, and in discriminating mixed populations. Importantly, the availability of multiple sensing pores provides a robust mechanism to overcome the clogging issue, allowing the analysis to continue even when some of the pores are clogged. We anticipate this {TDMA} approach could ﬁnd wide applications and facilitate future development of multiplexed resistive pulse sensing from the microscale to nanoscale.},

In general if N signal channels are to be provided over one line, the switching cycle includes N equal time intervals, one of which is allotted to each channel. Each channel is connected to the line throughout a part of its particular time interval and is disconnected throughout the remainder of the cycle. Absence of interference between the channels depends upon the fact that the channels are connected to the line throughout mutually exclusive time intervals. It is thus possible to avoid the use of channel band filters such as are necessary in carrier systems employing frequency as the basis of separation.},

Some of these applications have real-time requirements, while other non-real-time applications only require good average performance. For cost-efficient design, contemporary platforms feature an increasing number of cores that share resources, such as memories and interconnects. However, resource sharing causes contention that must be resolved by a resource arbiter, such as Time-Division Multiplexing. A key challenge is to configure this arbiter to satisfy the bandwidth and latency requirements of the real-time applications, while maximizing the slack capacity to improve performance of their non-real-time counterparts. As this configuration problem is {NP}-hard, a sophisticated automated configuration method is required to avoid negatively impacting design time. The main contributions of this article are: (1) an optimal approach that takes an existing integer linear programming ({ILP}) model addressing the problem and wraps it in a branch-and-price framework to improve scalability.

As a proof-of-concept, we have designed, fabricated, and tested a four-channel digital {TDM} readout circuit. The proposed scheme can be generalized for a larger number of channels. The readout circuit comprises an array of {ADCs} to digitize sensor outputs, a multiplexing unit, a clock controller, and a counter with parallel-to-serial output interface. For demonstration purposes, we employed low-pass phase modulation-demodulation {ADCs} running in a synchronous mode of operation. To facilitate an independent verification of circuit operation, we also placed an on-chip pattern generator to apply a unique pattern to each channel. The multiplexing unit is based on an array of sequentially triggered switches, each controlling the flow of data from a single {ADC} to a common output bus. In our scheme, the switches are realized using {RS}-flip-flops with nondestructive ({RSN}) readout cells with only one {RSN} cell turned on at a time. Multiplexed output data were stored in ripple counter based on T-flip-flops and read out to room temperature electronics using a serial interface. The chip was immersed in liquid helium at 4.2-K temperature and extensively evaluated at sampling frequencies up to 12.8 {GHz}. By means of embedded pattern generators, we proved the correct operation of each channel and of all four channels combined. We also were able to perform reconstruction of a signal applied to individual {ADC}. The chip was fabricated using {HYPRES}' 4.5-{kA}/cm2 process with four Nb metal layers.

We propose a novel method to amplify such deviations through periodic modulation of the trapping frequency in a levitated mechanical oscillator. We identify specific regimes where the {SN}-induced effects on the dynamics of second moments are significantly enhanced-by up to six orders of magnitude compared to unmodulated setups. We show that this protocol remains feasible within current magnetic levitation technologies and enables distinguishability between standard and {SN} dynamics using measurable quantities such as the position variance. Our results pave the way for a viable experimental test of the {SN} equation, offering a new route to probe the interface between quantum mechanics and gravity.},

Here, we present a protocol of linear amplification of mean values and fluctuations along an arbitrary phase space variable and squeezing along the complementary one, referred to as a nanomechanical state amplifier. It utilizes the experimental platform of a single optically levitating nanoparticle and the three-step protocol combines a controlled fast switching of the parabolic trapping potential to an inverted parabolic potential and back to the parabolic potential. The protocol can be sequentially repeated or extended to shape the nanomechanical state appropriately. Experimentally, we achieve amplification of position with a gain of ∣G∣ ≃ 2 and a classical squeezing coefficient above 4 {dB} in as short a timestep as one period of nanoparticle oscillations (7.6 μs). Amplification in velocity, with the same parameters, squeezes the input noise and enhances force sensing.},

	abstract = {The heating rate plays a crucial role in the decoherence of the harmonic motion of an optically levitated nanoparticle. The values of this rate vary depending on both the scattering photon rate and the kinetic energy acquired through individual photon recoils. While the combined roles of these factors have been extensively studied, the energy transfer per recoil has not been explicitly examined. This energy transfer is often approximated using a linear dipole model with coefficients \${\textbackslash}\{1/5, 2/5, 7/5{\textbackslash}\}\$ which applies in the Rayleigh limit. In this work, we analyze the evolution of energy transfer per photon recoil for low-absorption dielectric nanospheres with diameters ranging from 2 nm to 500 nm. Using a far-field approximation, we demonstrate that the Kerker condition, which enhances the alignment between incident and scattered wavevectors, may significantly reduce the energy transferred per recoil. Although this reduction is counterbalanced by the increasing scattering rate, for an individual scattering event, the reduction of recoil suggests an intrinsic suppression of back-action. Our results reveal a potential enhancement in the accuracy of estimations in tabletop experiments involving Mie particles of the considered sizes and provide guidance for the selection of optimal probe sizes and materials. Our interpretation of recoil reduction as a manifestation of back-action suppression indicates the potential for quantum nondemolition ({QND}) measurements by tailoring scattered radiation patterns with metamaterials.},

            This chapter covers the basics of quantum noise and the subtle aspects of Caves’ theorem on quantum-limited amplifiers. It introduces on the one hand the susceptibilities of a quantum measurement system, and on the other the crucial Nyquist model of dissipation, which is essential to the understanding of the quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem for a passive system and the constraints on noise for an active system. Great insight on the paradoxical properties of quantum noise can be obtained by comparing, in the calculation of the noise of an active circuit, the point of view of susceptibilities and response functions with the point of view of input-output theory dominated by the formalism of the scattering matrix. In particular, the chapter provides an explanation of the existence of different optimum working points for a nonmatched amplifier if one optimizes the gain or the noise.},

An arbitrary linear combination of the position and momentum of the particle is continuously monitored, and feedback proportional to the measured signal is used to control the system. We derive a feedback master equation and discuss a general approach to computing the steady-state solutions for arbitrary potentials. For a quantum harmonic oscillator or a free particle, we show that it is possible to cool and confine the system using feedback that simultaneously damps the measured observable and its conjugate momentum, as well as compensates for noise introduced by the measurement. In addition, we demonstrate that appropriate feedback adds a quadratic term in the measured observable to the Hamiltonian of the system. For the particular case of the harmonic potential, we describe the exact dynamics of the system that can be cooled to the ground state. Moreover, we provide an argument for the possibility to cool systems with arbitrary potentials provided that the measurement is strong enough to localise the particle on an interval smaller than the characteristic length scale of the potential.},

	abstract = {We experimentally study the interference of dipole scattered light from two optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum, which present an environment free of particle-substrate interactions. We illuminate the two trapped nanoparticles with a linearly polarized probe beam orthogonal to the propagation of the trapping laser beams. The scattered light from the nanoparticles are collected by a high numerical aperture ({NA}) objective lens and imaged. The interference fringes from the scattered vector light for the different dipole orientations in image and Fourier space are observed. Especially, the interference fringes of two scattered light fields with polarization vortex show the \&\#x03C0; shift of the interference fringes between inside and outside the center region of the two nanoparticles in the image space. As far as we know, this is the first experimental observation of the interference of scattered vector light fields from two dipoles in free space. This work also provides a simple and direct method to determine the spatial scales between optically levitated nanoparticles by the interference fringes.},

This opens the way to the realization of an ensemble of coupled, macroscopic quantum oscillators. Here, we demonstrate the trapping of two nanospheres inside a dual optical tweezer generated by two copropagating lasers operating at different wavelengths (1064 nm and 976 nm). Due to the chromatic aberration of the tweezer optics, two focal points are created approximately 9 µm apart, each acting as an optical trap for a silica nanoparticle. At this distance, surface charges on the nanospheres produce a Coulomb force that couples their motion along the tweezer axis. The strong coupling regime is achieved, as evidenced by the observed avoided crossing of the normal-mode frequencies. These results highlight the potential of our experimental scheme for future studies on systems of strongly coupled oscillators, including their implementation in optical cavities, both in the classical and quantum regimes.},

This approach leverages {EMCCD}'s intrinsic fast row transfer dynamics by introducing a tilted lens array into the imaging path, creating a spatially distributed grid of exposed pixels, each aligned to its own column of the sensor. The remaining unexposed pixels serve as in-situ storage registers, allowing subsequent frames to be captured after just one row shift operation. Our interlaced fast kinetics camera maintains 50\% contrast for square wave intensity modulation frequencies up to 1.61 {MHz}. We provide benchmarks of the video performance by capturing two dimensional videos of spatially evolving patterns that repeat every 2\${\textbackslash}mu\$s, with spatial resolution of 11\${\textbackslash}times\$15 pixels.

	abstract = {Tunable directional scattering is of paramount importance for operation of antennas, routing of light, and design of topologically protected optical states. For visible light scattered on a nanoparticle, the directionality could be provided by the Kerker effect, exploiting the interference of electric and magnetic dipole emission patterns. However, magnetic optical resonances in small sub-100-nm particles are relativistically weak. Here, we predict inelastic scattering with the unexpectedly strong tunable directivity up to 5.25 driven by a trembling of a small particle without any magnetic resonance. The proposed optomechanical Kerker effect originates from the vibration-induced multipole conversion. We also put forward an optomechanical spin-Hall effect, the inelastic polarization-dependent directional scattering. Our results uncover an intrinsically multipolar nature of the interaction between light and mechanical motion and apply to a variety of systems from cold atoms to two-dimensional materials to superconducting qubits. An application for engineering of chiral optomechanical coupling and nonreciprocal transmission at nanoscale is proposed.},

	abstract = {This paper quantifies the rate at which laser shot-noise energy is delivered to a nanoparticle for the various scenarios commonly encountered in levitated optomechanics. Although previous articles have the same form and dependencies, the proportionality constants often differ in the literature. This paper resolves these discrepancies. The rate at which energy is delivered to an optically trapped particle's respective degrees of freedom depends on the radiation pattern of scattered light as well as the direction of laser propagation. For a traveling plane wave with linearly polarized light in the Rayleigh regime, this leads the translational shot-noise heating rate to be proportional to 1/10 of the total rate in the laser polarization direction, 7/10 in the laser propagation direction, and 2/10 in the direction perpendicular to both. Analytical expressions for the shot-noise heating rate are provided in the Rayleigh limit as well as numerical calculations for particles in the Mie regime for silica and diamond. For completeness, numerical calculations of the shot-noise heating for silica Mie particles at the focus of a strongly focused laser beam are calculated for varying numerical aperture and common laser wavelengths. Both numerical calculations show that the Rayleigh expression generally gives an overestimate of the shot-noise heating especially for larger radii but is still a good approximation even for incident focal fields. The exception to the relative decrease is when a Mie resonance is reached which was found for diamond. Lastly, Rayleigh expressions for the rotational shot-noise heating for a symmetric toplike particle for linear, elliptically, and unpolarized light are also provided.},

However, it is still common to deduce the optical forces from assumptions based on the particle size with respect to the trapping laser wavelength. This shows the necessity to develop a complete and accurate electromagnetic model that does not depend on early approximations of the force model. Furthermore, the model we have developed has several advantages, such as morphology-dependent resonances, size dependence for large spheres, and multipole effects from smaller particles, just to name a few.

Understanding the dynamics of the interaction can lead to rich new effects, such as enhanced coupling and multi-body physics. In particular, multi-resonator optomechanical systems allow for distinct dynamical effects due to the optical cavity coherently coupling mechanical resonators. Here, we study the mechanical response of two {SiN} membranes and a single optical mode, and find that the cavity induces a time delay between the local and cavity-transduced thermal noises experienced by the resonators. This results in an optomechanical phase lag that causes destructive interference, cancelling the mechanical thermal noise by up to 20 {dB} in a controllable fashion and matching our theoretical expectation. Based on the effective coupling between membranes, we further propose, derive, and measure a collective effect, cooperativity competition on mechanical dissipation, whereby the linewidth of one resonator depends on the coupling efficiency (cooperativity) of the other resonator.},

Realizing these experiments has so far been difficult, because of the need for extremely precise positioning of the elements relative to one another due to the high-reflectivity required for each element. Here we overcome this challenge and present the fabrication of monolithic arrays of two highly reflective mechanical resonators in a single chip. We characterize the optical spectra and losses of these 200 μm long Fabry-Pérot interferometers, measuring finesse values of up to 220. In addition, we observe an enhancement of the coupling rate between the cavity field and the mechanical center-of-mass mode compared to the single membrane case. Further enhancements in coupling with these devices are predicted, potentially reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime, giving these integrated structures an exciting prospect for future multimode quantum experiments.},

	abstract = {Technological developments over the past two decades have resulted in the development of more accurate and lightweight low-cost magnetic and inertial measurement units ({MIMUs}). These developments have allowed the extensive application of {MIMUs} in various fields, specifically tracking the 3D orientation of a rigid body. Despite recent technological improvements, measurements from a tri-axial gyroscope, accelerometer, and/or magnetometer inside the {MIMU} are characterized by uncertainties. Numerous studies have been conducted to address these uncertainties and develop sensor fusion algorithms ({SFAs}) to estimate the 3D orientation accurately and robustly. This paper contributes to these efforts by providing a survey of the state-of-the-art {SFAs} for orientation estimation. We surveyed +250 publications, categorized the {SFAs} with various structures, identified the modifications proposed to improve their performance, and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. We found that, while early {SFAs} were mostly a vector observation algorithm or an extended Kalman filter, to improve the computational efficiency, more recent works have developed {SFAs} with a complementary filter or complementary Kalman filter structure. At the same time, to improve the performance of the {SFAs}, several research teams have proposed various modifications to the basic structure of these filters, such as adaptive gain tuning or imperfect measurement rejection. We also provided an outlook on the lessons learned as well as the main challenges related to {SFAs} and discussed the practical steps toward developing an effective {SFA}. We have identified the need for benchmarking studies as the main challenge at the moment. This paper is among the first surveys which provide such breadth of coverage across different {SFAs} for tracking orientation with {MIMUs}.},

It allows extracting information from several different sources to integrate them into single signal or information. In many cases sources of information are sensors or other devices that allow for perception or measurement of changing environment. Information received from multiple-sensors is processed using “sensor fusion” or “data fusion” algorithms. These algorithms can be classified into three different groups. First, fusion based on probabilistic models, second, fusion based on least-squares techniques and third, intelligent fusion. The probabilistic model methods are Bayesian reasoning, evidence theory, robust statistics, recursive operators. The least-squares techniques are Kalman filtering, optimal theory, regularization and uncertainty ellipsoids. The intelligent fusion methods are fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms. This paper will present three different methods of intelligent information fusion for different engineering applications. Chapter 2 is based on Sasiadek and Wang (2001) paper and presents an application of adaptive Kalman filtering to the problem of information fusion for guidance, navigation, and control.

Zusammenfassung
Diese Arbeit stellt einen Ansatz vor zur Schätzung eines Musters oder einer Signalform aus einer Menge verrauschter Messungen mit verschiedenen Amplitudenniveaus. Es wird ebenfalls die geglättete Rekonstruktion der von jedem Sensor empfangenen Signale betrachtet. Im Fall von unabhängigen und normalverteilten Meβfehlern stützt sich das Maximum-Likelihood-Verfahren auf die Singularwertzerlegung einer entsprechend zusammengestellten Datenmatrix. Es werden numerische Grenzen für den Schätzfehler angegeben. Statistische Analysen der Schätzer werden durchgeführt. Der Fall von unterschiedlichen Rauschvarianzen der Sensoren wird ebenfalls betrachtet.

	abstract = {Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-Pérot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that off-resonant coupling between light and the intermembrane cavity can lead to coherent mechanical noise cancellation. On-resonance coupling of light with both the Fabry-Pérot and intermembrane cavities, predicted to enhance the single-photon optomechanical coupling, have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-Pérot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double-membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly fourfold enhancement for the collective motion of 𝑅 =65\% double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.},

By coherently operating the optomechanical sensor array and distributing squeezing to entangle the optical fields, the array of sensors has a scaling advantage over independent sensors (i.e., \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{M\}{\textbackslash}to M\$\$, where M is the number of sensors) due to coherence as well as joint noise suppression due to multi-partite entanglement.

	abstract = {Summary form only given. The field of optomechanics [1] seeks to explore the interaction between light and mechanical motion. Optomechanical system are typically composed of a single mechanical and a single optical mode interacting via radiation pressure: Ĥint = -ħg0 â†â(b + b†), where â/b are the photon/phonon operators. In this talk, we will introduce arrays of optomechanical cells, and discuss our first theoretical results on the nonlinear dynamics of such a setup [2,3].First we have studied the classical nonlinear dynamics of optomechanical arrays. For blue-detuned laser drive, a Hopf bifurcation towards self-sustained mechanical oscillations takes place. For static disorder of the frequencies in the array, we have shown that there can be a transition towards phase-locking. The slow dynamics of the mechanical oscillation phase field is described by a specific modification of the Kuramoto equation known in synchronization physics: in the simplest case δ φ = -δΩ - Ksin(2δφ), for the phase difference δφ between two cells with frequency difference δΩ, corresponding to a particle sliding down in a tilted washboard potential.In a second step, we have turned towards the quantum dynamics of arrays without static disorder [3]. There, the effects of the fundamental quantum noise can lead to phase diffusion. Upon increasing the coupling between cells, we observe a transition between incoherent mechanical oscillations and a collective phase-coherent mechanical state. To study the driven-dissipative dynamics, we employ a mean-field approach based on the Lindblad master equation, as well as semiclassical Langevin equations. We will also discuss the prospects of observing this non-equilibrium dynamics in an experimental implementation based on currently available setups. Very promising candidates in this regard are optomechanical crystal setups, where defects in photonic crystal structures are used to generate co-localized optical and mechanical modes in a two-dimensional geometry [4].},

We then derive the laser recoil heating rates and the information radiation patterns (the angular distribution of the scattered light that carries information about the center-of-mass motion) and show how to evaluate them efficiently in the presence of a focused laser beam, in either a running- or a standing-wave configuration. This information is crucial to implement active feedback cooling of optically levitated dielectric spheres beyond the point-dipole approximation. Our results predict several experimentally feasible configurations and parameter regimes where optical detection and active feedback can simultaneously cool to the ground state the three-dimensional center-of-mass motion of dielectric spheres in the micrometer regime.

We calculate both the information losses of objective collection and mode-matching in levitated optomechanical experiments. Our results conclude that the backward detection scheme, using an incident Gaussian beam focused by a high numerical aperture lens, provides sufficient information to achieve the quantum ground state through cooling of the three-dimensional c.m. motion of the Mie particle.},

We take advantage of the tunability of the optical interactions between the particles in our system and set the optical interaction between the particles to be purely non-reciprocal. By continuously varying the relative power of the trapping beams, we take the system through a transition similar to a parity–time phase transition. A Hopf bifurcation at a critical point results in the formation of collective limit cycle oscillations, resembling those observed in phonon lasers. These coupled levitated oscillators provide a platform for exceptional point optomechanical sensing and can be extended to multi-particle systems, paving the way for the development of topological optomechanical media.},

Individual atoms are promising candidates for quantum networking due to their capability to emit indistinguishable photons that are entangled with their internal atomic states. Integrating atom arrays with photonic interfaces would enable distributed architectures in which nodes hosting many processing qubits could be efficiently linked together via the distribution of remote entanglement. However, many atom array techniques cease to work in close proximity to photonic interfaces, with atom detection via standard fluorescence imaging presenting a major challenge due to scattering from nearby photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate an architecture that combines atom arrays with up to 64 optical tweezers and a millimeter-scale photonic chip hosting more than 100 nanophotonic cavities. We achieve high-fidelity ( {\textasciitilde} 99.2\%), background-free imaging in close proximity to nanofabricated cavities using a multichromatic excitation and detection scheme. The atoms can be imaged while trapped a few hundred nanometers above the dielectric surface, which we verify using Stark shift measurements of the modified trapping potential. Finally, we rearrange atoms into defect-free arrays and load them simultaneously onto the same or multiple devices.},

All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states11, to implement an iconic many-body problem—the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries—square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics.},

	abstract = {Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)\% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99\%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.},

Already with two separate arrays, we implement combined 2D configurations of 3000 qubit sites with a mean number of 1167(46) single-atom quantum systems. The transfer of atoms between the two arrays is achieved with high efficiency. Thus, supercharging one array designated as the quantum processing unit with atoms from the secondary array significantly increases the number of qubits and the initial filling fraction. This drastically enlarges attainable qubit cluster sizes and success probabilities allowing us to demonstrate the defect-free assembly of clusters of up to 441 qubits with persistent stabilization at a near-unity filling fraction over tens of detection cycles. The presented method substantiates neutral atom quantum information science by facilitating configurable geometries of highly scalable quantum registers with immediate application in Rydberg-state-mediated quantum simulation, fault-tolerant universal quantum computation, quantum sensing, and quantum metrology.},

However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected ‘logical’ qubits, in which information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2–4, poses substantial challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Using logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral-atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10–15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encoding, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface-code6 distance from d = 3 to d = 7, preparation of colour-code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger ({GHZ}) states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 colour-code qubits. Finally, using 3D [[8,3,2]] code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical {CCZ} gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical-qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22.

Arrays of two or more of these particles have been suggested for improving force sensitivity and entangling macroscopic objects. In this article, two charged, silica nanoparticles, that are coupled through their mutual Coulomb repulsion, are trapped in a Paul trap, and the individual masses and charges of both particles are characterized. We demonstrate sympathetic cooling of one nanoparticle coupled via the Coulomb interaction to the second nanoparticle to which feedback cooling is directly applied. We also implement sympathetic squeezing through a similar process showing nonthermal motional states can be transferred by the Coulomb interaction. This work establishes protocols to cool and manipulate arrays of nanoparticles for sensing and minimizing the effect of optical heating in future experiments.},

Here we demonstrate programmable cavity-mediated interactions between nanoparticles in vacuum by combining advances in multiparticle optical levitation and cavity-based quantum control. The interaction is mediated by photons scattered by spatially separated particles in a cavity, resulting in strong coupling that is long-range in nature. We investigate the scaling of the interaction strength with cavity detuning and interparticle separation and demonstrate the tunability of interactions between different mechanical modes.

In this work, we exploit the phase coherence between the optical fields that drive the light-induced dipole-dipole interaction to couple two nanoparticles.

	abstract = {The hypothetical axion particle (of unknown mass) is a leading candidate for dark matter ({DM}). Many experiments search for axions with microwave cavities, where an axion may convert into a cavity photon, leading to a feeble excess in the output power of the cavity. Recent work [Backes et al., Nature 590, 238 (2021)] has demonstrated that injecting squeezed vacuum into the cavity can substantially accelerate the axion search. Here, we go beyond and provide a theoretical framework to leverage the benefits of quantum squeezing in a network setting consisting of many sensor cavities. By forming a local sensor network, the signals among the cavities can be combined coherently to boost the axion search. Furthermore, injecting multipartite entanglement across the cavities—generated by splitting a squeezed vacuum—enables a global noise reduction. We explore the performance advantage of such a local, entangled sensor network, which enjoys both coherence between the axion signals and entanglement between the sensors. Our analyses are pertinent to next-generation {DM}-axion searches aiming to leverage a network of sensors and quantum resources in an optimal way. Finally, we assess the possibility of using a more exotic quantum state, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill ({GKP}) state. Despite a constant-factor improvement in the scan time relative to a single-mode squeezed state in the ideal case, the advantage of employing a {GKP} state disappears when a practical measurement scheme is considered.},

In this work, we propose the use of magnetically levitated superconductors to detect dark-photon and axion dark matter through their couplings to electromagnetism. Several existing laboratory experiments search for these dark-matter candidates at high frequencies, but few are sensitive to frequencies below 1 {kHz} (corresponding to dark-matter masses 𝑚{DM} ≲10−12 {eV}). As a mechanical resonator, magnetically levitated superconductors are sensitive to lower frequencies, and so can probe parameter space currently unexplored by laboratory experiments. Dark-photon and axion dark matter can source an oscillating magnetic field that drives the motion of a magnetically levitated superconductor. This motion is resonantly enhanced when the dark matter Compton frequency matches the levitated superconductor’s trapping frequency. We outline the necessary modifications to make magnetically levitated superconductors sensitive to dark matter, including specifications for both broadband and resonant schemes. We show that in the Hz≲𝑓{DM}≲{kHz} frequency range our technique can achieve the leading sensitivity among laboratory probes of both dark-photon and axion dark matter.},

The physics case of these particles has been considerably developed in recent years, and there are now useful guidelines and powerful motivations to attempt experimental detection. Admittedly, the lack of a positive signal of new physics at the high energy frontier, and in underground detectors searching for weakly interacting massive particles, is also contributing to the increase of interest in axion searches. The experimental landscape is rapidly evolving, with many novel detection concepts and new experimental proposals. An updated account of those initiatives is lacking in the literature. In this review we attempt to provide such an update. We will focus on the new experimental approaches and their complementarity, but will also review the most relevant recent results from the consolidated strategies and the prospects of new generation experiments under consideration in the field.

In this study, a levitated optomechanical system with a force detection sensitivity of 6.33 ± 1.62 {zN}/Hz1/2 was demonstrated. And for the first time, the Allan variance was introduced to evaluate the system stability due to the force sensitivity fluctuations.

Here, we proposes a method to measure the net charge accurately through its thermally and harmonically driven motional signals. With the numerical calculation of the dynamic temperature of the optically-levitated nanoparticle, the long-term dynamic net charge on the nanoparticle can be tracked. This method can achieve an accurate measurement with the accuracy of better than 5\% at thermal equilibrium pressures of more than 10 mbar and accuracy of {\textasciitilde}20\% till 3 mbar, where the net charge barely changes spontaneously, and nonlinearities in the levitated oscillator is relatively small. As the net charge is integer discrete, the method provides nearly completely accurate measurements of nanoparticles with few charges. The result can be applied to improve the measurement accuracy for mass and density through iteration and this method provides a way toward non-contact characterization of aerology, space dust, etc.},

This article reviews in a selective way the recent research on the interface between machine learning and the physical sciences. This includes conceptual developments in {ML} motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross fertilization between the two fields. After giving a basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, examples are described of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in {ML}. This review then describes applications of {ML} methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many-body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. Research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating {ML} are also highlighted.

Various current and upcoming experiments are searching for signatures of new physics. Despite the variety of approaches and theoretical models tested in these experiments, what they all have in common is the very large volume of complex data that they produce. This data challenge calls for powerful statistical methods. Machine learning has been in use in high-energy particle physics for well over a decade, but the rise of deep learning in the early 2010s has yielded a qualitative shift in terms of the scope and ambition of research. These modern machine learning developments are the focus of the present Review, which discusses methods and applications for new physics searches in the context of terrestrial high-energy physics experiments, including the Large Hadron Collider, rare event searches and neutrino experiments.},

	abstract = {Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum are a promising model system to test physics beyond our current understanding of quantum mechanics. Such experimental tests require extreme control over the dephasing of the levitated particle's motion. If the nanoparticle carries a finite net charge, it experiences a random Coulomb force due to fluctuating electric fields. This dephasing mechanism can be fully excluded by discharging the levitated particle. Here, we present a simple and reliable technique to control the charge on an optically levitated nanoparticle in vacuum. Our method is based on the generation of charges in an electric discharge and does not require additional optics or mechanics close to the optical trap.Physics Subject Headings ({PhySH})Cooling \& {trappingOptical} tweezerswindow.{articlePhySH} = \{"concepts":\{"0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf":\{"id":"0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf","label":"Cooling \& trapping","paths":[[\{"id":"fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","label":"Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","type":"facet"\},\{"id":"0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf","label":"Cooling \& trapping","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf","type":"concept"\}]]\},"0d68bfc9-8cf3-46cf-b51d-c91e1e052bd4":\{"id":"0d68bfc9-8cf3-46cf-b51d-c91e1e052bd4","label":"Optical tweezers","paths":[[\{"id":"fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","label":"Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","type":"facet"\},\{"id":"a38dc017-3236-4084-afc5-eb59c5de51e0","label":"Optical techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/a38dc017-3236-4084-afc5-eb59c5de51e0","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"dedc6dbe-3651-4ad0-9d37-b260e8975adc","label":"Laser techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/dedc6dbe-3651-4ad0-9d37-b260e8975adc","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"0d68bfc9-8cf3-46cf-b51d-c91e1e052bd4","label":"Optical tweezers","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/0d68bfc9-8cf3-46cf-b51d-c91e1e052bd4","type":"concept"\}]]\}\}\};},

	abstract = {Nonclassical optomechanical correlations enable optical control of mechanical motion beyond the limitations of classical driving. Here we investigate the feasibility of using pulsed cavity optomechanics to create and verify nonclassical phase-sensitive correlations between light and the motion of a levitated nanoparticle in a realistic scenario. We show that optomechanical two-mode squeezing can persist even at the elevated temperatures of state-of-the-art experimental setups. We introduce a detection scheme based on optical homodyning that allows the revealing of nonclassical correlations without full optomechanical state tomography. We provide an analytical treatment using the rotating-wave approximation ({RWA}) in the resolved-sideband regime and prove its validity with a full numerical solution of the Lyapunov equation beyond the {RWA}. We build on parameters of current experiments for our analysis and conclude that the observation of nonclassical correlations, which are essential for quantum sensing, quantum engines, and quantum simulations with levitated nanoparticles, is possible with state-of-the-art capabilities. The general treatment can be applied to other optomechanical platforms.Physics Subject Headings ({PhySH})Entanglement {detectionEntanglement} {productionOptomechanicsQuantum} information with hybrid

	shorttitle = {Large Quantum Delocalization of a Levitated Nanoparticle Using Optimal Control},
	abstract = {We propose to optimally control the harmonic potential of a levitated nanoparticle to quantum delocalize its center-of-mass motional state to a length scale orders of magnitude larger than the quantum zero-point motion. Using a bang-bang control of the harmonic potential, including the possibility of inverting it, the initial ground-state-cooled levitated nanoparticle coherently expands to large scales and then contracts to the initial state in a time-optimal way. We show that this fast loop protocol can be used to enhance force sensing as well as to dramatically boost the entangling rate of two weakly interacting nanoparticles. We parameterize the performance of the protocol, and therefore the macroscopic quantum regime that could be explored, as a function of displacement and frequency noise in the nanoparticle’s center-of-mass motion. This noise analysis accounts for the sources of decoherence relevant to current experiments.Physics Subject Headings ({PhySH})Entanglement {productionOptomechanicsQuantum} {controlQuantum}

	abstract = {We provide a general quantum theory to describe the coupling of light with the motion of a dielectric object inside a high-finesse optical cavity. In particular, we derive the total Hamiltonian of the system as well as a master equation describing the state of the center-of-mass mode of the dielectric and the cavity-field mode. In addition, a quantum theory of elasticity is used to study the coupling of the center-of-mass motion with internal vibrational excitations of the dielectric. This general theory is applied to the recent proposal of using an optically levitating nanodielectric as a cavity optomechanical system [see Romero-Isart et al., New J. Phys. 12, 033015 (2010); Chang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA} 107, 1005 (2010)]. On this basis, we also design a light-mechanics interface to prepare non-Gaussian states of the mechanical motion, such as quantum superpositions of Fock states. Finally, we introduce a direct mechanical tomography scheme to probe these genuine quantum states by time-of- flight experiments.See 1 more figures},

Presuming the (anti)neutrino source to be a nuclear fission reactor, we utilize the estimated flux and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus cross section to constrain the spatial separation Δ⁢𝑥 and describe the temporal evolution of the sensing system. Particularly, we find that a potentially measurable relative phase between quantum superposed components is obtained for a single gram scale mass placed in a superposition of spatial components separated by 10−14 m under sufficient cooling and background suppression.Physics Subject Headings ({PhySH})Open quantum systems \& {decoherenceQuantum} {sensingNeutrino} detectionwindow.{articlePhySH} = \{"concepts":\{"9b6aaf50-04bd-4aaa-b4c3-d6fa9b7f7303":\{"id":"9b6aaf50-04bd-4aaa-b4c3-d6fa9b7f7303","label":"Quantum sensing","paths":[[\{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"06b2397a-c546-4dad-89bc-a90c7df4b439","label":"Quantum communication, protocols \& technology","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/06b2397a-c546-4dad-89bc-a90c7df4b439","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"53cd9599-5951-4fa6-af4e-2ff2c0e53fe4","label":"Quantum metrology","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/53cd9599-5951-4fa6-af4e-2ff2c0e53fe4","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"9b6aaf50-04bd-4aaa-b4c3-d6fa9b7f7303","label":"Quantum sensing","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/9b6aaf50-04bd-4aaa-b4c3-d6fa9b7f7303","type":"concept"\}]]\},"9557aa49-72bb-404d-afe9-76ca9e5e5ef2":\{"id":"9557aa49-72bb-404d-afe9-76ca9e5e5ef2","label":"Neutrino detection","paths":[[\{"id":"fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","label":"Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","type":"facet"\},\{"id":"be8bd934-5bc9-4a6d-ae73-f4753ce5c128","label":"Particle detectors","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/be8bd934-5bc9-4a6d-ae73-f4753ce5c128","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"9557aa49-72bb-404d-afe9-76ca9e5e5ef2","label":"Neutrino detection","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/9557aa49-72bb-404d-afe9-76ca9e5e5ef2","type":"concept"\}]]\},"fce63f54-4c30-4bd4-b3b6-1a4d58bdaceb":\{"id":"fce63f54-4c30-4bd4-b3b6-1a4d58bdaceb","label":"Open quantum systems \& decoherence","paths":[[\{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"01f70d47-cbac-4b5a-8ff9-0768e722511b","label":"Quantum correlations, foundations \& formalism","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/01f70d47-cbac-4b5a-8ff9-0768e722511b","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"fce63f54-4c30-4bd4-b3b6-1a4d58bdaceb","label":"Open quantum systems \& decoherence","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/fce63f54-4c30-4bd4-b3b6-1a4d58bdaceb","type":"concept"\}]]\}\}\};Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Quantum control of their motion (including potential shaping) predisposes them for emulating various physical systems and studying quantum phenomena with massive objects. Extending these capabilities to quantum many-body systems requires feasible strategies to couple and entangle nanoparticles directly or via an optical bus. We propose a variable, deterministic scheme to generate Gaussian entanglement in the motional steady state of levitated nanoparticles using coherent scattering. Coupling multiple nanoparticles to a common cavity mode allows cooling of a collective Bogoliubov mode; cooling multiple Bogoliubov modes (by trapping each nanoparticle in multiple tweezers, each scattering into a separate cavity mode) removes most thermal noise, leading to strong entanglement. Numerical simulations for three nanoparticles show great tuneability of entanglement with realistic experimental parameters. Our proposal paves the way towards complex motional quantum states for advanced quantum sensing protocols and many-body quantum simulations.},

	abstract = {The strong light-matter optomechanical coupling offered by coherent scattering set-ups have allowed the experimental realization of quantum ground-state cavity cooling of the axial motion of a levitated nanoparticle [U. Delić et al., Science 367, 892 (2020)]. An appealing milestone is now quantum two-dimensional (2D) cooling of the full in-plane motion, in any direction in the transverse plane. By a simple adjustment of the trap polarization, one obtains two nearly equivalent modes, with similar frequencies 𝜔𝑥∼𝜔𝑦 and optomechanical couplings 𝑔𝑥≃𝑔𝑦—in this experimental configuration we identify an optimal trap ellipticity, nanosphere size, and cavity linewidth which allows for efficient 2D cooling. Moreover, we find that 2D cooling to occupancies 𝑛𝑥+𝑛𝑦≲1 at moderate vacuum (10−6 mbar) is possible in a “Goldilocks” zone bounded by √𝜅⁢Γ/4≲𝑔𝑥,𝑔𝑦≲{\textbar}𝜔𝑥−𝜔𝑦{\textbar}≲𝜅, where one balances the need to suppress dark modes while avoiding far-detuning of either mode or low cooperativities, and 𝜅 (Γ) is the cavity decay rate (motional heating rate). With strong-coupling regimes 𝑔𝑥,𝑔𝑦≳𝜅 in view one must consider the genuine three-way hybridization between 𝑥,𝑦 and the cavity light mode resulting in hybridized bright/dark modes. Finally, we show that bright/dark modes in the levitated set-up have a simple geometrical interpretation, related by rotations in the transverse plane, with implications for directional sensing.Physics Subject Headings ({PhySH}){OptomechanicsMicromechanical} \& nanomechanical {oscillatorsNanoparticlesCooling} \& trappingwindow.{articlePhySH} = \{"concepts":\{"2d7a7b42-9db0-4027-8b95-43b276a198c0":\{"id":"2d7a7b42-9db0-4027-8b95-43b276a198c0","label":"Optomechanics","paths":[[\{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"23cdcd6b-ae22-4b6d-92cd-24a9a8bd0577","label":"Optics \& lasers","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/23cdcd6b-ae22-4b6d-92cd-24a9a8bd0577","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"2d7a7b42-9db0-4027-8b95-43b276a198c0","label":"Optomechanics","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/2d7a7b42-9db0-4027-8b95-43b276a198c0","type":"concept"\}]]\},"4fd30a9d-7de5-44a0-82dd-d4b18d88721b":\{"id":"4fd30a9d-7de5-44a0-82dd-d4b18d88721b","label":"Nanoparticles","paths":[[\{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"a38f8c2b-eff3-4e4d-8146-e17ef6bde9dd","label":"Nanostructures","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/a38f8c2b-eff3-4e4d-8146-e17ef6bde9dd","type":"concept"\},\{"id":"4fd30a9d-7de5-44a0-82dd-d4b18d88721b","label":"Nanoparticles","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/4fd30a9d-7de5-44a0-82dd-d4b18d88721b","type":"concept"\}]]\},"a831f274-1508-4eca-a092-fdeb3a36e2ed":\{"id":"a831f274-1508-4eca-a092-fdeb3a36e2ed","label":"Micromechanical \& nanomechanical oscillators","paths":[[\{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"a831f274-1508-4eca-a092-fdeb3a36e2ed","label":"Micromechanical \& nanomechanical oscillators","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/a831f274-1508-4eca-a092-fdeb3a36e2ed","type":"concept"\}]]\},"0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf":\{"id":"0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf","label":"Cooling \& trapping","paths":[[\{"id":"fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","label":"Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/fa2a6718-de5c-4c05-bf00-f169a55234d5","exclude\_from\_indexing":true,"type":"facet"\},\{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","type":"facet"\},\{"id":"0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf","label":"Cooling \& trapping","uri":"https://doi.org/10.29172/0b6b113c-8f3d-421e-a149-940af26931cf","type":"concept"\}]]\}\}\};Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In contrast to commonly used nebulizer-based trap-loading methods that generate aerosolized liquid droplets containing nanoparticles, the method produces dry aerosols of both spherical and high-aspect ratio particles ranging in size by approximately two orders of magnitude. The device has been shown to generate accelerations of order 107 g, which is sufficient to overcome stiction forces between glass nanoparticles and a glass substrate for particles as small as 170 nm in diameter. Particles with sizes ranging from 170 nm to ∼10μm have been successfully loaded into optical traps at pressures ranging from 1 bar to 0.6 mbar. We report the velocity distribution of the particles launched from the substrate, and our results indicate promise for direct loading into ultra-high-vacuum with sufficient laser feedback cooling. This loading technique could be useful for the development of compact fieldable sensors based on optically levitated nanoparticles as well as matter–wave interference experiments with ultra-cold nano-objects, which rely on multiple repeated free-fall measurements and thus require rapid trap re-loading in high vacuum conditions.},

The technique of cold damping makes use of feedback-controlled, electrostatic forces to increase dissipation without introducing additional thermal fluctuations. This process has been instrumental in the ground-state cooling of individual electrically charged nanoparticles. Here we show that the same method can be applied to a pair of nanoparticles, coupled by optical binding forces. These optical binding forces are about three orders of magnitude stronger than typical Coulombic inter-particle force and result in a coupled motion of both nanoparticles characterized by a pair of normal modes. We demonstrate cold damping of these normal modes, either independently or simultaneously, to sub-Kelvin temperatures at pressures of 5×10−3 m b a r. Experimental observations are captured by a theoretical model that we use to survey the parameter space more widely and to quantify the limits imposed by measurement noise and time delays.

In this coupled levitated system, we create a thermal squeezed state of motion in one of the nanoparticles by parametrically driving it and then transferring the state to the other nanoparticle with high fidelity. The transfer mechanism is based on inducing a non-reciprocal type of coupling in the system by suitably modulating the phases of the trapping lasers and the inter-particle distance between the levitated nanoparticles. This non-reciprocal coupling creates a unidirectional channel where information flows from one nanoparticle to the other nanoparticle but not vice versa, thereby allowing for transfer of mechanical states between the nanoparticles with high fidelity. We also affirm this transfer mechanism by creating and efficiently transferring a random-phase coherent state in the coupled levitated system. Further, we make use of the feedback nonlinearity and parametric driving to create simultaneous bistability in the coupled levitated system.

Recent demonstrations of the measurement-based ground-state cooling of a single nanoparticle employ linear velocity feedback, also called cold damping, and require the use of electrostatic forces on charged particles via external electrodes. Here we introduce an all-optical cold damping scheme based on the spatial modulation of trap position, which has the advantage of being scalable to multiple particles. The scheme relies on programmable optical tweezers to provide full independent control over the trap frequency and position of each tweezer. We show that the technique cools the centre-of-mass motion of particles along one axis down to 17 {mK} at a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar and demonstrate its scalability by simultaneously cooling the motion of two particles. Our work paves the way towards studying quantum interactions between particles; achieving three-dimensional quantum control of particle motion without cavity-based cooling, electrodes or charged particles; and probing multipartite entanglement in levitated optomechanical systems.},

	abstract = {In 1872, Maxwell proposed his famous ‘demon’ thought experiment1. By discerning which particles in a gas are hot and which are cold, and then performing a series of reversible actions, Maxwell’s demon could rearrange the particles into a manifestly lower-entropy state. This apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics was resolved by twentieth-century theoretical work2: the entropy of the Universe is often increased while gathering information3, and there is an unavoidable entropy increase associated with the demon’s memory4. The appeal of the thought experiment has led many real experiments to be framed as demon-like. However, past experiments had no intermediate information storage5, yielded only a small change in the system entropy6,7 or involved systems of four or fewer particles8–10. Here we present an experiment that captures the full essence of Maxwell’s thought experiment. We start with a randomly half-filled three-dimensional optical lattice with about 60 atoms. We make the atoms sufficiently vibrationally cold so that the initial disorder is the dominant entropy. After determining where the atoms are, we execute a series of reversible operations to create a fully filled sublattice, which is a manifestly low-entropy state. Our sorting process lowers the total entropy of the system by a factor of 2.44. This highly filled ultracold array could be used as the starting point for a neutral-atom quantum computer.},

Today, the increasing demand for applied quantum technologies requires adaptation of this level of control to individual quantum systems2,3. Achieving this in an optimal way is a challenging task that relies on both quantum-limited measurements and specifically tailored algorithms for state estimation and feedback4. Successful implementations thus far include experiments on the level of optical and atomic systems5–7. Here we demonstrate real-time optimal control of the quantum trajectory8 of an optically trapped nanoparticle. We combine confocal position sensing close to the Heisenberg limit with optimal state estimation via Kalman filtering to track the particle motion in phase space in real time with a position uncertainty of 1.3 times the zero-point fluctuation. Optimal feedback allows us to stabilize the quantum harmonic oscillator to a mean occupation of 0.56 ± 0.02 quanta, realizing quantum ground-state cooling from room temperature. Our work establishes quantum Kalman filtering as a method to achieve quantum control of mechanical motion, with potential implications for sensing on all scales.

	abstract = {Tests of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale require extreme control over mechanical motion and its decoherence1–3. Quantum control of mechanical motion has been achieved by engineering the radiation–pressure coupling between a micromechanical oscillator and the electromagnetic field in a resonator4–7. Furthermore, measurement-based feedback control relying on cavity-enhanced detection schemes has been used to cool micromechanical oscillators to their quantum ground states8. In contrast to mechanically tethered systems, optically levitated nanoparticles are particularly promising candidates for matter-wave experiments with massive objects9,10, since their trapping potential is fully controllable. Here we optically levitate a femtogram (10−15 grams) dielectric particle in cryogenic free space, which suppresses thermal effects sufficiently to make the measurement backaction the dominant decoherence mechanism. With an efficient quantum measurement, we exert quantum control over the dynamics of the particle. We cool its centre-of-mass motion by measurement-based feedback to an average occupancy of 0.65 motional quanta, corresponding to a state purity of 0.43. The absence of an optical resonator and its bandwidth limitations holds promise to transfer the full quantum control available for electromagnetic fields to a mechanical system. Together with the fact that the optical trapping potential is highly controllable, our experimental platform offers a route to investigating quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales11.},

	abstract = {We report on the two-dimensional (2D) dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle in an optical cavity. The motion of the nanosphere is strongly coupled to the cavity field by coherent scattering and heavily cooled in the plane orthogonal to the tweezer axis. Due to the characteristics of the 2D motion and the strong optomechanical coupling, the motional sideband asymmetry that reveals the quantum nature of the dynamics is not limited to mere scale factors between Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks, as customary in quantum optomechanics, but assumes a peculiar spectral dependence. We introduce and discuss an effective thermal occupancy that quantifies how close the system is to a minimum uncertainty state and allows us to consistently characterize the particle motion. By rotating the polarization angle of the tweezer beam we tune the system from a 1D cooling regime, where we achieve a best thermal occupancy of 0.51±0.05, to a regime in which the fully 2D dynamics of the particle exhibit strong nonclassical properties. We achieve a strong 2D confinement with thermal occupancy of 3.4±0.4 along the warmest direction and around one in the orthogonal one. These results represent a major improvement over previous experiments considering both the 1D and the 2D motion and pave the way toward the preparation of tripartite optomechanical entangled states and novel applications to directional force and displacement quantum sensing.},

With the recent achievement of ground-state cooling of a single motional mode, levitated nanoparticles have entered the quantum domain. To overcome detrimental cross-coupling and decoherence effects, quantum control needs to be expanded to more system dimensions, but the effect of a decoupled dark mode has so far hindered cavity-based ground-state cooling of multiple mechanical modes. Here, we demonstrate two-dimensional ground-state cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle. Utilizing coherent scattering into an optical cavity mode, we reduce the occupation numbers of two separate centre-of-mass modes to 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. By controlling the frequency separation and the cavity coupling strengths of the nanoparticle’s mechanical modes, we show the transition from 1D to 2D ground-state cooling. This 2D control lays the foundations for quantum-limited orbital angular momentum states for rotation sensing and, combined with ground-state cooling along the third motional axis shown previously, may allow full 3D ground-state cooling of a massive object.},

Many experimental platforms are being explored, including solid-state systems, such as superconducting circuits1 or quantum dots2, and atomic, molecular and optical systems, such as photons, trapped ions or neutral atoms3–7. The latter offer inherently identical qubits that are well decoupled from the environment and could provide synthetic structures scalable to hundreds of qubits or more8. Quantum-gas microscopes9 allow the realization of two-dimensional regular lattices of hundreds of atoms, and large, fully loaded arrays of about 50 microtraps (or ‘optical tweezers’) with individual control are already available in one10 and two11 dimensions. Ultimately, however, accessing the third dimension while keeping single-atom control will be required, both for scaling to large numbers and for extending the range of models amenable to quantum simulation. Here we report the assembly of defect-free, arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional arrays, containing up to 72 single atoms. We use holographic methods and fast, programmable moving tweezers to arrange—atom by atom and plane by plane—initially disordered arrays into target structures of almost any geometry. These results present the prospect of quantum simulation with tens of qubits arbitrarily arranged in space and show that realizing systems of hundreds of individually controlled qubits is within reach using current technology.},

Among other things, this enables the orientation of irregularly shaped and relatively large structures which could not be oriented by just one trap as is demonstrated on long Escherichia coli bacteria filaments. We expect that the multiple trap manipulator will broaden the field of applications of optical trapping as a micromanipulation technique. For example, it facilitates the study of mechanical properties of extended structures as illustrated by a "bending"-experiment using E. coli bacterium filaments. A special application of the multiple trap manipulator is the "indirect trapping" of objects which we did by keeping them held between other optically trapped particles. Indirect trapping makes it possible to trap particles which either cannot be trapped directly due to their optical properties (refractive index) or for which exposure to the laser radiation is undesirable. The multiple optical trap manipulator is controlled interactively by a {UNIX} workstation coupled to a {VME} instrumentation bus. This provides great flexibility in the control of the position and the orientation of the optical traps. Micromanipulation makes it desirable to have real time 3D microscopy for imaging and guidance of the optical traps. Therefore we integrated optical micromanipulation and a specially developed real-time confocal microscope. This so called bilateral confocal scanning laser microscope (bilateral {CSLM}) [Brakenhoff and Visscher, J Microsc 165:139-146, 1992] produces images at video rate.},

The addition of the axial information offers true three-dimensional position detection in solution, creating, together with a position control, a photonic force microscope with nanometer spatial and microsecond temporal resolution. The measured position signals are explained as interference of the unscattered trapping laser beam with the laser light scattered by the trapped bead. Our model explains experimental data for trapped particles in the Rayleigh regime (radius a {\textless}0.2lambda) for displacements up to the focal dimensions. The cross-talk between the signals in the three directions is explained and it is shown that this cross-talk can be neglected for lateral displacements smaller than 75 nm and axial displacements below 150 nm.

Here we demonstrate a coupling mechanism that is orders of magnitude stronger and has new qualitative features. These effects arise from the previously unexplored phase coherence between the optical fields that drive the light-induced dipole-dipole interaction. In addition, polarization control allows us to observe electrostatic coupling between charged particles in the array.

Levitated optomechanical systems have recently entered the multi-particle regime, with promise for using arrays of massive strongly coupled oscillators for exploring complex interacting systems and sensing. Here, by combining advances in multi-particle optical levitation and cavity-based quantum control, we demonstrate, for the first time, programmable cavity-mediated interactions between nanoparticles in vacuum. The interaction is mediated by photons scattered by spatially separated particles in a cavity, resulting in strong coupling (\$G\_{\textbackslash}text\{zz\}/{\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}text\{z\} = 0.238{\textbackslash}pm0.005\$) that does not decay with distance within the cavity mode volume. We investigate the scaling of the interaction strength with cavity detuning and inter-particle separation, and demonstrate the tunability of interactions between different mechanical modes. Our work paves the way towards exploring many-body effects in nanoparticle arrays with programmable cavity-mediated interactions, generating entanglement of motion, and using interacting particle arrays for optomechanical sensing.},

Here, we demonstrate the trapping of two nanospheres inside a dual optical tweezer generated by two copropagating lasers operating at different wavelengths (1064 nm and 976 nm). Due to the chromatic aberration of the tweezer optics, two focal points are created approximately 9 𝜇m apart, each one acting as an optical trap for a silica nanoparticle. At this distance, the surface charges on the nanospheres produce a Coulomb force that couples their motion along the tweezer axis. The strong coupling regime is achieved, as evidenced by the observed avoided crossing of the normal-mode frequencies. These results highlight the potential of our experimental scheme for future studies on systems of strongly coupled oscillators, including their implementation in optical cavities, both in the classical and in quantum regime.},

Remarkably, the levitated-particle accelerometer has a sensitivity down to 3.6×10−8g/√Hz and gives measurements similar to those of the commercial geophone at frequencies up to 14 Hz despite a test mass that is four billion times smaller. With no free parameters in the calibration, the responses of the accelerometers match within 3\% at 5 Hz. The system reaches this sensitivity due to a relatively large particle mass of 0.25𝜇⁢g, a low center-of-mass oscillation frequency of 1.75 Hz, and an image-analysis method that can measure the displacement with an uncertainty of 1.6 nm in a single image.},

This critical issue can be addressed in levitodynamics, where the nanoresonator typically consists of a single silica nanoparticle of well-defined mass. Yet, current methods assess the mass of the levitated nanoparticles with uncertainties up to a few tens of percent, therefore preventing to achieve unprecedented sensing performances. Here, we present a novel measurement protocol that uses the electric field from a surrounding plate capacitor to directly drive a charged optically levitated particle in moderate vacuum. The developed technique estimates the mass within a statistical error below 1\% and a systematic error of ∼2\%, and paves the way toward more reliable sensing and metrology applications of levitodynamics systems.},

	abstract = {The existence of a light mediator is beneficial to some phenomena in astroparticle physics, such as the core-cusp problem and diversity problem. It can decouple from Standard Model to avoid direct detection constraints, generally realized by retard decay of the mediator. Their out-of-equilibrium decay process changes the dark matter ({DM}) freeze-out via temperature discrepancy. This type of hidden sector ({HS}) typically requires a precision calculation of the freeze-out process considering {HS} temperature evolution and the thermal average of the cross-section. If the mediator is light sufficiently, we can not ignore the s-wave radiative bound state formation process from the perspective of {CMB} ionization and Sommerfeld enhancement. We put large mass splitting between {DM} and mediator, different temperature evolution on the same theoretical footing, discussing the implication for {DM} relic density in this {HS}. We study this model and illustrate its property by considering the general Higgs-portal dark matter scenario, which includes all the relevant constraints and signals. It shows that the combination of {BBN} and {CMB} constraint favors the not-too-hot {HS}, \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{inf\}\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}2\$, for the positive cubic interaction of mediator scenario.

The Chou-Yang model is then introduced to reduce the number of input parameters to one based on the simplicity and analyticity principle. A new definition of velocity dependence and the corresponding implications on the small cosmological structures from Chou-Yang dark protons are shown clearly. Even though the parameter space is not fully covered, the numerical findings show that the amplitude coefficient can alter the self-scattering cross-section, allowing us to recover the excluded parameter space without using binding force.

Besides, we find a residue momentum dependence in the quark-nucleon matching procedure, even without a light mediator. Such behavior can enhance the sensitivity compared with conventional contact interaction. We promote this endeavor by deriving direct limits on sub-{GeV} spin-dependent boosted dark matter through terrestrial data.

It appears naturally in forbidden dark matter annihilation, the main focus of this work, which contains fermionic {DM} and a light singlet scalar that connects the {DM} and standard model ({SM}) leptons. The strong suppression of the scattering between {DM} and {SM} particles happens quite early in the {DM} depletion history, where the {DM} temperature drops away from the thermal equilibrium, \$T\_{\textbackslash}chi {\textless} T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SM}\}\$, leading to the decreased kinetic energy of {DM}. The forbidden annihilation thus becomes inefficient since small kinetic energy cannot help exceed the annihilation threshold, naturally leading to a larger abundance. To show the {eKD} discrepancy, we numerically solve the coupled Boltzmann equations that govern the evolution of {DM} number density and temperature. It is found that {eKD} significantly affects the {DM} abundance, resulting in almost an order of magnitude higher than that by the traditional calculation.

The decays of heavy dark matter particles in the Galactic halo may produce high-energy electrons that can be detected by {LHAASO}. The main background for the {LHAASO}'s {CR} electron measurements is the hadron residuals due to mis-identification of the particle species. In this paper, we estimate the {LHAASO}'s electron background using the known all-particle {CR} spectrum and the hadron rejection efficiency of {LHAASO}. With the estimated background, we predict the capability of {LHAASO} to constrain {DM} decay lifetime at 95\% confidence level for various channels. We find that, if neglecting systematic uncertainties, the {CR} electron measurement by {LHAASO} can improve the current best results by up to on order of magnitude for {DM} masses between 100 - 1000TeV. However, indirect measurements of {CR} electrons by ground-based experiments suffer from uncertainties included in the calculation, the projected constraints will be largely weakened. So for using the {CR} electron observation of {LHAASO} to constrain the {DM} parameters, the key point is whether the systematic error can be effectively reduced.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2312.04202},
	abstract = {If the terrestrial environment is permeated by dark matter, the levitation experiences damping forces and fluctuations attributed to dark matter. This paper investigates levitodynamics with multiple stochastic forces, including thermal drag, photon recoil, feedback, etc., assuming that all of these forces adhere to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The ratio of total damping to the stochastic damping coefficient distinguishes the levitodynamics from cases involving only one single stochastic force. The heating and cooling processes are formulated to determine the limits of temperature change. All sources of stochastic forces are comprehensively examined, revealing that dark matter collisions cannot be treated analogously to fluid dynamics. Additionally, a meticulous analysis is presented, elucidating the intricate relationship between the fundamental transfer cross-section and the macroscopic transfer cross-section. While the dark damping coefficient is suppressed by the mass of the levitated particle, scattering can be coherently enhanced based on the scale of the component microscopic particle, the atomic form factor, and the static structure factor. Hence, dark damping holds the potential to provide valuable insights into the detection of the macroscopic strength of fundamental particles. We propose experimental procedures for levitation and employ linear estimation to extract the dark damping coefficient. Utilizing current levitation results, we demonstrate that the fundamental transfer cross section of dark matter can be of the order \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm D\}\_\{T\}{\textbackslash}lsim \{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\}){\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2\$.},

We achieve state-expansion factors of 25 in standard deviation for a particle initially feedback-cooled to a center-of-mass thermal state of {\textbackslash}{SI}\{155\}\{{\textbackslash}milli{\textbackslash}kelvin\}. Our method relies on a hybrid scheme combining an optical trap, for cooling and measuring the particle's motion, with a Paul trap for expanding its state.

	abstract = {The traditional view from particle physics is that quantum gravity effects should only become detectable at extremely high energies and small length scales. Due to the significant technological challenges involved, there has been limited progress in identifying experimentally detectable effects that can be accessed in the foreseeable future. However, in recent decades, the size and mass of quantum systems that can be controlled in the laboratory have reached unprecedented scales, enabled by advances in ground-state cooling and quantum-control techniques. Preparations of massive systems in quantum states paves the way for the explorations of a low-energy regime in which gravity can be both sourced and probed by quantum systems. Such approaches constitute an increasingly viable alternative to accelerator-based, laser-interferometric, torsion-balance, and cosmological tests of gravity. In this review, we provide an overview of proposals where massive quantum systems act as interfaces between quantum mechanics and gravity. We discuss conceptual difficulties in the theoretical description of quantum systems in the presence of gravity, review tools for modeling massive quantum systems in the laboratory, and provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art experimental landscape. Proposals covered in this review include, among others, precision tests of gravity, tests of gravitationally-induced wavefunction collapse and decoherence, as well as gravity-mediated entanglement.

	abstract = {Today's mechanical sensors are capable of detecting extremely weak perturbations while operating near the standard quantum limit. However, further improvements can be made in both sensitivity and bandwidth when we reduce the noise originating from the process of measurement itself -- the quantum-mechanical backaction of measurement -- and go below this 'standard' limit, possibly approaching the Heisenberg limit. One of the ways to eliminate this noise is by measuring a quantum nondemolition variable such as the momentum in a free-particle system. Here, we propose and characterize theoretical models for direct velocity measurement that utilize traditional electric and magnetic transducer designs to generate a signal while enabling this backaction evasion. We consider the general readout of this signal via electric or magnetic field sensing by creating toy models analogous to the standard optomechanical position-sensing problem, thereby facilitating the assessment of measurement-added noise. Using simple models that characterize a wide range of transducers, we find that the choice of readout scheme -- voltage or current -- for each mechanical detector configuration implies access to either the position or velocity of the mechanical sub-system. This in turn suggests a path forward for key fundamental physics experiments such as the direct detection of dark matter particles.},

In this work, we propose the use of magnetically levitated superconductors to detect dark-photon and axion dark matter through their couplings to electromagnetism. Several existing laboratory experiments search for these dark-matter candidates at high frequencies, but few are sensitive to frequencies below \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{1{\textbackslash},{kHz}\}\$ (corresponding to dark-matter masses \$m\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{DM}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{eV}\}\$). As a mechanical resonator, magnetically levitated superconductors are sensitive to lower frequencies, and so can probe parameter space currently unexplored by laboratory experiments. Dark-photon and axion dark matter can source an oscillating magnetic field that drives the motion of a magnetically levitated superconductor. This motion is resonantly enhanced when the dark matter Compton frequency matches the levitated superconductor's trapping frequency. We outline the necessary modifications to make magnetically levitated superconductors sensitive to dark matter, including specifications for both broadband and resonant schemes. We show that in the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Hz\}{\textbackslash}lesssim f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{DM}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{kHz}\}\$ frequency range our technique can achieve the leading sensitivity amongst laboratory probes of both dark-photon and axion dark matter.},

For such puffy {DM} self-interaction cross-section in the resonant and classical regimes, our study demonstrates the significance of the Yukawa potential and the necessity of partial wave analysis: (i) Due to the finite-size effect of puffy {DM} particles, the new Yukawa potential of puffy {DM} is found to enlarge the Born-effective regime for the self-interaction cross-section, compared with the point-like {DM}; (ii) Our partial wave analysis shows that depending on the value of the ratio between \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}chi\}\$ (radius of a puffy {DM} particle) and \$1/m\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}\$ (force range), the three regimes (Born-effective, resonant and classical) for puffy {DM} self-interaction cross-section can be very different from the point-like {DM}; (iii) We find that to solve the small-scale anomalies via self-interacting puffy {DM}, the Born-effective and the resonant regimes exist for dwarf galaxies, while for the cluster and Milky Way galaxy the non-Born regime is necessary.},

	abstract = {Optomechanical devices are being harnessed as sensors of ultraweak forces for applications ranging from inertial sensing to the search for the elusive dark matter. For the latter, there is a focus on detection of either higher energy single recoils or ultralight, narrowband sources; a directional signal is expected. However, the possibility of searching for a stochastic stream of weak impulses, or more generally a directional broadband signal, need not be excluded; with this and other applications in mind, we investigate the experimental signature of Gaussian white noise impulses with a well defined direction \${\textbackslash}Psi\$ on a levitated nanosphere, trapped and 3D cooled in an optical tweezer. We find that cross-correlation power spectra offer a calibration-free distinctive signature of the presence of a directional but stochastic microscopic force and its orientation quadrant, unlike normal power spectral densities ({PSDs}). We obtain excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results. With calibration we are able to measure the angle \${\textbackslash}Psi\$, akin to a force compass in a plane. We discuss prospects for extending this technique into quantum regime and compare the expected behaviour of quantum baths and classical baths.},

We investigate the dynamics of this system, especially in the so-called self-trapping regimes, where one or more optical fields simultaneously trap and cool the mechanical oscillator. The determining characteristic of this regime is that both the mechanical frequency \${\textbackslash}omega\_M\$ and single-photon optomechanical coupling strength parameters \$g\$ are a function of the optical field intensities, in contrast to usual set-ups where \${\textbackslash}omega\_M\$ and \$g\$ are constant for the given system. We also measure the characteristic transverse and axial trapping frequencies of different sized silica nanospheres in a simple optical standing wave potential, for spheres of radii \$r=20-500\${\textbackslash},nm, illustrating a protocol for loading single nanospheres into a standing wave optical trap that would be formed by an optical cavity. We use this data to confirm the dependence of the effective optomechanical coupling strength on sphere radius for levitated nanospheres in an optical cavity and discuss the prospects for reaching regimes of strong light-matter coupling. Theoretical semiclassical and quantum displacement noise spectra show that for larger nanospheres with \$r {\textbackslash}gtrsim 100\${\textbackslash},nm a range of interesting and novel dynamical regimes can be accessed. These include simultaneous hybridization of the two optical modes with the mechanical modes and parameter regimes where the system is bistable. We show that here, in contrast to typical single-optical mode optomechanical systems, bistabilities are independent of intracavity intensity and can occur for very weak laser driving amplitudes.},

              Optical resonators are essential for fundamental science, applications in sensing and metrology, particle cooling, and quantum information processing. Cavities can significantly enhance interactions between light and matter. For many applications they perform this task best if the mode confinement is tight and the photon lifetime is long. Free access to the mode center is important in the design to admit atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, or solids into the light field. Here, we demonstrate how to machine microcavity arrays of extremely high quality in pristine silicon. Etched to an almost perfect parabolic shape with a surface roughness on the level of 2 Å and coated to a finesse exceeding
              F
               = 500,000, these new devices can have lengths below 17 µm, confining the photons to 5 µm waists in a mode volume of 88λ
              3
              . Extending the cavity length to 150 µm, on the order of the radius of curvature, in a symmetric mirror configuration yields a waist smaller than 7 µm, with photon lifetimes exceeding 64 ns. Parallelized cleanroom fabrication delivers an entire microcavity array in a single process. Photolithographic precision furthermore yields alignment structures that result in mechanically robust, pre-aligned, symmetric microcavity arrays, representing a light-matter interface with unprecedented performance.},

	shorttitle = {Levitated optomechanics},
	abstract = {Optomechanics, the study of the mechanical interaction of light with matter, has proven to be a fruitful area of research that has yielded many notable achievements, including the direct detection of gravitational waves in kilometer-scale optical interferometers. Light has been used to cool and demonstrate quantum control over the mechanical degrees of freedom of individual ions and atoms, and more recently has facilitated the observation of quantum “mechanics” in objects of larger mass, even at the kg-scale. Levitated optomechanics, where an object can be suspended by radiation pressure and largely decoupled from its environment, has recently established itself as a rich field of study, with many notable results relevant for precision measurement, quantum information science, and foundational tests of quantum mechanics and fundamental physics. This article provides a survey of several current activities in field along with a tutorial describing associated key concepts and methods, both from an experimental and theoretical approach. It is intended as a resource for junior researchers who are new to this growing field as well as beginning graduate students. The tutorial is concluded with a perspective on both promising emerging experimental platforms and anticipated future theoretical developments.},

Most protocols for preparing these states necessitate coherent expansion beyond the scale of the zero-point motion to produce sufficiently delocalized and pure phase-space distributions. Here, we spatially expand and subsequently recontract the thermal state of a levitated nanoparticle by modifying the stiffness of the trap holding the particle. We achieve state-expansion factors of 25 in standard deviation for a particle initially feedback-cooled to a center-of-mass thermal state of {\textbackslash}{SI}\{155\}\{{\textbackslash}milli{\textbackslash}kelvin\}. Our method relies on a hybrid scheme combining an optical trap, for cooling and measuring the particle's motion, with a Paul trap for expanding its state. Consequently, state expansion occurs devoid of measurement backaction from photon recoil, making this approach suitable for coherent wavefunction expansion in future experiments.},

	abstract = {Identifying the true theory of dark matter depends crucially on accurately characterizing interactions of dark matter ({DM}) with other species. In the context of {DM} direct detection, we present a study of the prospects for correctly identifying the low–energy effective {DM}–nucleus scattering operators connected to {UV}–complete models of {DM}–quark interactions. We take a census of plausible {UV}–complete interaction models with diﬀerent low–energy leading–order {DM}–nuclear responses. For each model (corresponding to diﬀerent spin–, momentum–, and velocity–dependent responses), we create a large number of realizations of recoil–energy spectra, and use Bayesian methods to investigate the probability that experiments will be able to select the correct scattering model within a broad set of competing scattering hypotheses. We conclude that agnostic analysis of a strong signal (such as Generation–2 would see if cross sections are just below the current limits) seen on xenon and germanium experiments is likely to correctly identify momentum dependence of the dominant response, ruling out models with either “heavy” or “light” mediators, and enabling downselection of allowed models. However, a unique determination of the correct {UV} completion will critically depend on the availability of measurements from a wider variety of nuclear targets, including iodine or ﬂuorine. We investigate how model–selection prospects depend on the energy window available for the analysis. In addition, we discuss accuracy of the {DM} particle mass determination under a wide variety of scattering models, and investigate impact of the speciﬁc types of particle–physics uncertainties on prospects for model selection.},

As is well-known, for vector (dark photon) and pseudoscalar (axion-like particle) dark matter, the absorption rates can be simply related to the target material's optical properties. However, this is not the case for scalar dark matter, where the dominant contribution comes from a different operator than the one contributing to photon absorption, which is formally next-to-leading-order and does not suffer from in-medium screening. It is therefore imperative to have reliable first-principles numerical calculations and/or semi-analytic modeling in order to predict the detection rate.

Together with a mechanism for darko-baryo-genesis, which arises naturally from the grand unification sector, the mass densities of the two sectors must be nearby, explaining the observed mass density of dark matter. We focus on the simplest possible example of such a theory, where Standard Model color \${SU}(3)\_C\$ is unified with dark color \${SU}(2)\_D\$ into \${SU}(5)\$ at an intermediate scale of around \$10{\textasciicircum}8-10{\textasciicircum}9\$ {GeV}.

	abstract = {Direct detection experiments for dark matter are increasingly ruling out large parameter spaces. However, light dark matter models with particle masses \${\textless}\$ {GeV} are still largely unconstrained. Here we examine a proposal to use atom interferometers to detect a light dark matter subcomponent at sub-{GeV} masses. We describe the decoherence and phase shifts caused by dark matter scattering off of one "arm" of an atom interferometer using a generalized dark matter direct detection framework. This allows us to consider multiple channels: nuclear recoils, hidden photon processes, and axion interactions. We apply this framework to several proposed atom interferometer experiments. Because atom interferometers are sensitive to extremely low momentum deposition and their coherent atoms give them a boost in sensitivity, these experiments will be highly competitive and complementary to other direct detection methods. In particular, atom interferometers are uniquely able to probe a dark matter sub-component with \$m\_{\textbackslash}chi {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{{keV}\}\$. We find that, for a mediator mass \$m\_{\textbackslash}phi=10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}m\_{\textbackslash}chi\$, future atom interferometers could close a gap in the existing constraints on nuclear recoils down to \${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_n {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-50\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ for \$m\_{\textbackslash}chi {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\} - 10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{{MeV}\}\$ dark matter masses.},

We show that such a ﬁfth force, with strength modestly stronger than gravity at ranges greater than tens of kilometers (corresponding to mediator masses less than 10−11eV), can dramatically enhance dark matter kinetic heating, capture, and pulsar timing Doppler shifts relative to gravity plus short range interactions alone. Using the coldest observed {NS} and pulsar timing array ({PTA}) data, we derive limits on ﬁfth force strength over a {DM} mass range spanning light dark matter up to order solar mass composite {DM} objects. We also consider an indirect limit by combining bullet cluster limits on the {DM} self-interaction with weak equivalence principle test limits on baryonic self-interactions.

Since the pioneering work of Arthur Ashkin, where he used a single strongly focused laser beam, ever more complex experimental set-ups are required in order to perform novel and challenging experiments. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the theoretical background and experimental techniques. We start by giving an overview of the theory of optical forces: first, we consider optical forces in approximated regimes when the particles are much larger (ray optics) or much smaller (dipole approximation) than the light wavelength; then, we discuss the full electromagnetic theory of optical forces with a focus on T-matrix methods. Then, we describe the important aspect of Brownian motion in optical traps and its implementation in optical tweezers simulations. Finally, we provide a general description of typical experimental setups of optical tweezers and calibration techniques with particular emphasis on holographic optical tweezers.},

However, achieving quantitative Fourier space measurements requires a thorough understanding of the impact of aberrations introduced by optical microscopes, which have been optimized for conventional real-space imaging. Here, we present a detailed framework for analyzing the performance of microscope objectives for several common Fourier imaging configurations. To this end, we model objectives from Nikon, Olympus, and Zeiss using parameters that were inferred from patent literature and confirmed, where possible, by physical disassembly. We then examine the aberrations most relevant to Fourier microscopy, including the alignment tolerances of apodization factors for different objective classes, the effect of magnification on the modulation transfer function, and vignetting-induced reductions of the effective numerical aperture for wide-field measurements. Based on this analysis, we identify an optimal objective class and imaging configuration for Fourier microscopy. In addition, as a resource for future studies, the Zemax files for the objectives and setups used in this analysis have been made publicly available.},

	abstract = {In general, the optical binding force between identical particles is thought to be symmetric. However, we demonstrate analytically a counter-intuitively asymmetric longitudinal optical binding force between two identical electric and magnetic dipolar dielectric particles. This homodimer is confined in two counter-propagating incoherent plane waves along the dimer’s axis. The force consists of the electric dipolar, magnetic dipolar, and electricmagnetic dipolar coupling interactions. The combined effect of these interactions is markedly different than the expected behavior in the Rayleigh approximation. The asymmetric force is a result of the asymmetric forward and backward scattering of the particles due to the dipolar hybridization and coupling interactions. Consequently, it leads to a harmonic driving force on the pair, which decays with the interparticle distance to the first power. We show the rich nonequilibrium dynamics of the dimer and of the two particles impelled by the driving and binding forces and discuss the ranges of particle refractive index and size in which the asymmetric binding force arises. Our results open perspectives for nonequilibrium light-driven multiparticle transport and selfassembly.},

For a proper choice of the modulation frequency, this mechanism can drive the motion of the microdisks into an inseparable state in the long time limit via a two-mode squeezing process.

Motivated by this development, we here propose and analyze an array of levitated nanoparticles as an ideal platform to study non-Hermitian physics in a highly controlled manner. We employ the non-Bloch band theory to determine the continuum bands of the proposed setup and investigate the non-Hermitian skin effect therein. In particular, we point out that the levitated nanoparticle array exhibits rich dynamical phases, including the dynamically unstable phase and the unconventional critical phase where the spectral singularity persists over a broad region of the controllable parameters. We also show that the long-range nature of the dipole-dipole interaction gives rise to the unique self-crossing point of the continuum band.},

Here, we apply event-based imaging to detect the motion of a microparticle levitated under vacuum conditions, which greatly facilitates the study of nanothermodynamics and enables the independent detection and control of arrays of many particles.},

The stellar and gaseous discs provide virtually equal contributions to the galaxy gravitational potential at large galactocentric radii, but no obvious correlation is found between the radial distribution of dark matter and the distribution of stars or gas.Results of the best fit to the mass distribution in M33 picture a dark halo which controls the gravitational potential from 3 kpc outward, with a matter density which decreases radially as R−1.3. The density profile is consistent with the theoretical predictions for structure formation in hierarchical clustering cold dark matter ({CDM}) models, and favours lower mass concentrations than those expected in the standard cosmogony.},

	abstract = {Back-focal-plane interferometry is used to measure displacements of optically trapped samples with very high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the technique is closely related to a method that measures the rate of change in light momentum. It has long been known that displacements of the interference pattern at the back focal plane may be used to track the optical force directly, provided that a considerable fraction of the light is effectively monitored. Nonetheless, the practical application of this idea has been limited to counter-propagating, low-aperture beams where the accurate momentum measurements are possible. Here, we experimentally show that the connection can be extended to single-beam optical traps. In particular, we show that, in a gradient trap, the calibration product κ·β (where κ is the trap stiffness and 1/β is the position sensitivity) corresponds to the factor that converts detector signals into momentum changes; this factor is uniquely determined by three construction features of the detection instrument and does not depend, therefore, on the specific conditions of the experiment. Then, we find that force measurements obtained from back-focal-plane displacements are in practice not restricted to a linear relationship with position and hence they can be extended outside that regime. Finally, and more importantly, we show that these properties are still recognizable even when the system is not fully optimized for light collection. These results should enable a more general use of back-focal-plane interferometry whenever the ultimate goal is the measurement of the forces exerted by an optical trap.},

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

In addition, characteristics, properties and the (dis)advantages of {EODs} and {AODs}, when compared to mirror based mechanical deﬂectors, is discussed. Deﬂection angles, speed and accuracy are discussed in terms of resolvable spots and related quantities. Also, response time, damage threshold, efficiency and the type and magnitude of beam distortions is addressed. Optical deﬂectors are characterized by high angular deﬂection velocities, but small deﬂection angles. Whereas mechanical mechanical scanners are characterized by relatively small deﬂection velocities, but large deﬂection angles.

Ultracold atom and molecule arrays in optical tweezers in vacuum have been used for quantum simulation, quantum metrology and quantum computing. Recently, quantum ground state cooling of the center-of-mass motion of a single optically levitated nanoparticle in vacuum was demonstrated, providing unprecedented opportunities for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision measurements. In this work, we create a reconfigurable optically-levitated nanoparticle array in vacuum. Our optically-levitated nanoparticle array allows full control of individual nanoparticles to form an arbitrary pattern and detect their motion. As a concrete example, we choose two nanoparticles without rotation signals from an array to synthesize a nanodumbbell in-situ by merging them into one trap. The nanodumbbell synthesized in-situ can rotate beyond 1 {GHz}. Our work provides a new platform for studying macroscopic many-body physics.},

The nanosphere’s large mass as compared to other quantum systems enhances the susceptibility of the nanoparticle to gravitational and inertial forces. In this viewpoint we describe the features of experiments with optically levitated nanoparticles [2] and their proposed utility for acceleration sensing. Unique to the levitated nanoparticle platform is the ability to implement not only quantum noise limited transduction, predicted by quantum metrology to reach sensitivities on the order of 10−15 ms−2 [3], but also long-lived quantum spatial superpositions for enhanced gravimetry. This follows a global trend in developing sensors, such as cold atom interferometers, that exploit superposition or entanglement. Thanks to significant commercial development of these existing quantum technologies, we discuss the feasibility of translating levitated nanoparticle research into applications.},

When illuminated transversely by coherent light, collective light scattering into propagating ﬁber modes induces long-range interactions and eventually crystallization of the particles into regular order. We develop a simple and intuitive scattering-matrix based approach to study these long-range interactions by collective scattering and the resulting light-induced selfordering. For few particles we derive explicit conditions for self-consistent stable ordering. In the purely dispersive limit with negligible back-scattering, we recover the prediction of an equidistant lattice as previously found for eﬀective dipole-dipole interaction models. We generalize our model to experimentally more realistic conﬁgurations including backscattering, absorption and a directional scattering asymmetry. For larger particle ensembles the resulting self-consistent particle-ﬁeld equations can be numerically solved to study the formation of long-range order and stability limits.},

	abstract = {Arrays of optically trapped nanoparticles have emerged as a promising platform for the study of complex non-equilibrium phenomena. Analogous to atomic many-body systems, one of the crucial ingredients is the ability to precisely control the interactions between particles. However, the optical interactions studied thus far only provide conservative optical binding forces of limited tunability. Here we demonstrate a coupling mechanism that is orders of magnitude stronger and has new qualitative features. These effects arise from the previously unexplored phase coherence between the optical fields that drive the light-induced dipole-dipole interaction. In addition, polarization control allows us to observe electrostatic coupling between charged particles in the array. Our results pave the way for a fully programmable many-body system of interacting nanoparticles with tunable dissipative and nonreciprocal interactions, which are instrumental for exploring entanglement and topological phases in arrays of levitated nanoparticles.},

An objective with high numerical aperture ({NA}) for the optical trap has also been used to focus a detection beam. In that case the displacement of the probe at a fixed position of the detector produces a unique and linear response only in a restricted region of the probe displacement, usually several hundred nanometers. There are specific experiments where the absolute position of the probe is a relevant measure together with the probe position relative the optical trap focus. In our scheme we introduce the detection beam into the condenser with low {NA} through a pinhole with tunable size. This combination permits us to create a wide detection spot and to achieve the linear range of several micrometers by the probe position detection without reducing the trapping force.},

	abstract = {A technique for detecting the displacement of micron-sized optically trapped probes using far-field interference is introduced, theoretically explained, and used to study the motility of the ncd motor protein. Bead motions in the focal plane relative to the optical trap were detected by measuring laser intensity shifts in the back-focal plane of the microscope condenser by projection on a quadrant diode. This detection method is two-dimensional, largely independent of the position of the trap in the field of view and has ∼10-μs time resolution. The high resolution makes it possible to apply spectral analysis to measure dynamic parameters such as local viscosity and attachment compliance. A simple quantitative theory for back-focal-plane detection was derived that shows that the laser intensity shifts are caused primarily by a far-field interference effect. The theory predicts the detector response to bead displacement, without adjustable parameters, with good accuracy. To demonstrate the potential of the method, the {ATP}-dependent motility of ncd, a kinesin-related motor protein, was observed with an in vitro bead assay. A fusion protein consisting of truncated ncd (amino acids 195–685) fused with glutathione-S-transferase was adsorbed to silica beads, and the axial and lateral motions of the beads along the microtubule surface were observed with high spatial and temporal resolution. The average axial velocity of the ncd-coated beads was 230±30nm/s (average±{SD}). Spectral analysis of bead motion showed the increase in viscous drag near the surface; we also found that any elastic constraints of the moving motors are much smaller than the constraints due to binding in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide adenylylimidodiphosphate.},

A calculation for the usual type of acoustic amplitude modulation is described, and serves as an example of the type of detailed considerations that are necessary and possible, as well as a verification of the validity of the simple momentum considerations. It is shown that the product of the fraction of the light that may be scattered and the bandwidth for Bragg scattering equals a materials constant times the acoustic power. This relationship is shown to be valid even to the extent of numerical constants for several configurations allowing a trade-off between these parameters. Thus, the required modulation power for any level of device performance is easily determined. The details of acoustic deflection under conditions of acoustic beam focusing or scanning are also given.},

Here, we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled via coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states. Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by creating and characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states, and demonstrate the universal properties of an Ising quantum phase transition in (2+1) dimensions. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation, experimentally map the phase diagram, and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations. Offering a new lens into the study of complex quantum matter, these observations pave the way for investigations of exotic quantum phases, non-equilibrium entanglement dynamics, and hardware-efficient realization of quantum algorithms.},

We provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate {CMB} anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. The {WMAP} mission has resulted in a highly constrained {LCDM} cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When {WMAP} data are combined with finer scale {CMB}, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (3.84+/-0.40). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is 13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity reported earlier by {WMAP} now has high statistical significance (n\_s = 0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega\_k = -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the {WMAP} mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter {LCDM} model, based on {CMB} data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the {CMB} predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit, the inflationary flat {LCDM} model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in {WMAP} data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

Evidences from many different directions now all imply that five sixths of the material content of the Universe is in this mysterious form, separate from and beyond the ordinary ‘baryonic’ particles in the standard model of particle physics. Dark matter appears not to interact via the electromagnetic force, and therefore neither emits nor reflects light. However, it definitely does interact via gravity, and has played the most important role in shaping the Universe on large scales. The most successful technique with which to investigate it has so far been the effect of gravitational lensing. The curvature of space–time near any gravitating mass (including dark matter) deflects passing rays of light—observably shifting, distorting and magnifying the images of background galaxies. Measurements of such effects currently provide constraints on the mean density of dark matter, and its density relative to baryonic matter; the size and mass of individual dark matter particles and its cross-section under various fundamental forces.},

By time-multiplexing the laser focus, we can calibrate individually all traps and all tracking signals in a few seconds and in 3D. We show 3D histograms and calibration constants for nine beads in a quadratic arrangement, although trapping and tracking is easily possible for more beads also in arbitrary 2D arrangements. As an application, we investigate the hydrodynamic coupling and diffusion anomalies of spheres trapped in a 3 × 3 arrangement.},

A second study explores events observed following collisions between single particles and small clusters composed of charged particles derived from a metal oxide composite. As before, observations recorded during the course of the experiments are reproduced by the calculations. One study in particular reveals how particle polarizability can influence the assembly process.

Differing from previous studies, the spin of the nanoparticle about its symmetry axis is considered nonnegligible. Simulations reveal that standard parametric feedback cooling can extract energy from two of the five rotational degrees of freedom when the nanoparticle is levitated using a linearly polarized laser beam. The dynamics after feedback cooling are characterized by a normal mode describing precession about the laser polarization axis together with spin about the nanoparticle's symmetry axis. Cooling the remaining mode requires an asymmetry in the two librational frequencies associated with motion about the polarization axis as well as information about the two frequencies of rotation about the polarization axis. Introducing an asymmetric potential allows full cooling of the librational coordinates if the frequencies of both are used in the feedback modulation and is an avenue for entering the librational quantum regime. The asymmetry in the potential needs to be large enough for practical cooling times as the cooling rate of the system depends nonlinearly on the degree of asymmetry, a condition that is easily achieved experimentally.},

This picture is dramatically altered if there are significant self-interactions within the dark sector, potentially resulting in the coalescence of dark matter particles into large composite blobs. The low number density of these blobs necessitates new detector strategies. We study cosmological, astrophysical and direct detection bounds on this scenario and identify experimentally accessible parameter space. The enhanced interaction between large composite states and the standard model allows searches for such composite blobs using existing experimental techniques. This includes the detection of scintillation in {MACRO}, {XENON} and {LUX}; heat in calorimeters such as {CDMS}; acceleration and strain in gravitational wave detectors such as {LIGO} and {AGIS}; and spin precession in {CASPEr}. These searches leverage the fact that the transit of the dark matter occurs at a speed ∼220 km/s, well separated from relativistic and terrestrial sources of noise. They can be searched for either through modifications to the data analysis protocol or relatively straightforward adjustments to the operating conditions of these experiments.},

	abstract = {Asymmetric dark matter ({ADM}) is an attractive framework relating the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe to the dark matter density. A composite particle in a new strong dynamics is a promising candidate for {ADM} as the strong dynamics naturally explains the {ADM} mass in the {GeV} range. Its large annihilation cross section due to the strong dynamics leaves the asymmetric component to be dominant over the symmetric component. In such composite {ADM} scenarios, the dark sector has a relatively large entropy density in the early Universe. The large dark sector entropy results in the overclosure of the Universe or at best contradicts with the observations of the cosmic microwave background and the successful Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. Thus, composite {ADM} models generically require some portal to transfer the entropy of the dark sector into the Standard Model sector. In this paper, we consider a dark photon portal with a mass in the sub-{GeV} range and kinetic mixing with the Standard Model photon. We investigate the viable parameter space of the dark photon in detail, which can find broad applications to dark photon portal models. We also provide a simple working example of composite {ADM} with a dark photon portal. Our model is compatible with thermal leptogenesis and B − L symmetry. By taking into account the derived constraints, we show that the parameter space is largely tested by direct detection experiments.},

	abstract = {We investigate the interactions of large composite dark matter ({DM}) states with the Standard Model ({SM}) sector. Elastic scattering with {SM} nuclei can be coherently enhanced by factors as large as A2, where A is the number of constituents in the composite state (there exist models in which {DM} states of very large A ≳ 108 may be realised). This enhancement, for a given direct detection event rate, weakens the expected signals at colliders by up to 1/A. Moreover, the spatially extended nature of the {DM} states leads to an additional, characteristic, form factor modifying the momentum dependence of scattering processes, altering the recoil energy spectra in direct detection experiments. In particular, energy recoil spectra with peaks and troughs are possible, and such features could be confirmed with only \$\$ {\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(50) \$\$events, independently of the assumed halo velocity distribution. Large composite states also generically give rise to low-energy collective excitations potentially relevant to direct detection and indirect detection phenomenology. We compute the form factor for a generic class of such excitations — quantised surface modes — finding that they can lead to coherently-enhanced, but generally sub-dominant, inelastic scattering in direct detection experiments. Finally, we study the modifications to capture rates in astrophysical objects that follow from the elastic form factor, as well as the effects of inelastic interactions between {DM} states once captured. We argue that inelastic interactions may lead to the {DM} collapsing to a dense configuration at the centre of the object.},

The properties of suﬃciently large dark nuclei may obey simple scaling laws, and we ﬁnd that this scaling can determine the number distribution of nuclei resulting from Big Bang Dark Nucleosynthesis. For plausible models of asymmetric dark matter, dark nuclei of large nucleon number, e.g. 108, may be synthesised, with the number distribution taking one of two characteristic forms. If small-nucleon-number fusions are suﬃciently fast, the distribution of dark nuclei takes on a logarithmically-peaked, universal form, independent of many details of the initial conditions and small-number interactions. In the case of a substantial bottleneck to nucleosynthesis for small dark nuclei, we ﬁnd the surprising result that even larger nuclei, with size 108, are often ﬁnally synthesised, again with a simple number distribution. We brieﬂy discuss the constraints arising from the novel dark sector energetics, and the extended set of (often parametrically light) dark sector states that can occur in complete models of nuclear dark matter. The physics of the coherent enhancement of direct detection signals, the nature of the accompanying dark-sector form factors, and the possible modiﬁcations to astrophysical processes are discussed in detail in a companion paper.},

Here we propose a concept for direct dark matter detection using only this gravitational coupling. We suggest that an array of quantum-limited mechanical impulse sensors may be capable of detecting the correlated gravitational force created by a passing dark matter particle. We consider the effects of irreducible noise from couplings of the sensors to the environment and noise due to the quantum measurement process. We show that the signal from Planck-scale dark matter is in principle detectable using a large number of gram-scale sensors in a meter-scale array with sufficiently low quantum noise, and discuss some experimental challenges en route to achieving this target.},

Polystyrene ({PS}) microparticles adhered to the substrate can be selected based on size, shape, or optical properties and repeatedly loaded into the optical trap using a piezoelectric ({PZT}) transducer. Separation from the substrate leads to charge transfer through contact electrification. The charge on the trapped microparticles is measured from the response of the particle motion to a step excitation of a uniform electric field. The particle is then placed onto a target location of the substrate in a controlled manner. Thus, the triboelectric charging profile of the selected {PS} microparticle can be measured and controlled through repeated cycles of trap loading followed by charge measurement. Reversible optical trap loading and manipulation of the selected particle leads to new capabilities to study and control successive and small changes in surface interactions.},

This serves as a simple model system for describing laser trapping and manipulation of living cells and organelles within cells. The gradient and scattering forces are defined for beams of complex shape in the ray-optics limit. Forces are calculated over the entire cross-section of the sphere using {TEM}.0 and {TEM}* mode input intensity profiles and spheres of varying index of refraction. Strong uniform traps are possible with force variations less than a factor of 2 over the sphere cross-section. For a laser power of 10 {mW} and a relative index of refraction of 1.2 we compute trapping forces as high as - 1.2 x 10-6 dynes in the weakest (backward) direction of the gradient trap. It is shown that good trapping requires high convergence beams from a high numerical aperture objective. A comparison is given of traps made using bright field or differential interference contrast optics and phase contrast optics.},

Due to the large enhancement of the cross-section for dark matter to coherently scatter from a nanogram mass (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}\$ times that for a single neutron) and the ability to detect momentum transfers as small as \${\textbackslash}sim\$200 {MeV}/c, these results provide sensitivity to certain classes of composite dark matter models that substantially exceeds existing searches, including those employing kg-scale or ton-scale targets.

This low noise leads to an acceleration and force sensitivity of \$95{\textbackslash}pm41\$ n\$g/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Hz\}\}\$ (\$g = 9.8\$ m/s\${\textasciicircum}2\$) and \$0.95{\textbackslash}pm0.11\$ {aN}\$/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Hz\}\}\$, respectively, at frequencies near 50 Hz. This force sensitivity is comparable to that demonstrated for optically levitated nanospheres that are \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ times less massive, corresponding to an acceleration sensitivity that is several orders of magnitude better. It is further shown that under these conditions the spheres remain stably trapped at pressures of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$ mbar with no active cooling for periods longer than a day. Feedback cooling is still necessary in the moderate-pressure regime, motivating a comprehensive study of the loss mechanisms of the microspheres and providing better understanding of the requirements for feedback-free optical trapping in vacuum. This work can enable high-sensitivity searches for accelerations and forces acting on micron-sized masses, including those that could be produced by new physics beyond the Standard Model.},

We provide a model for the essential mechanism of this type of detection, giving a simple, closed-form analytic solution with simplifying assumptions. We identify intensity shifts as first-order far-field interference between the outgoing laser beam and scattered light from the trapped particle, where the latter is phase advanced owing to the Gouy phase anomaly. This interference also reflects momentum transfer to the particle, giving the spring constant of the trap. Our response formula is compared with the results of experiments.},

Back focal plane or Fourier plane imaging and spectroscopy techniques help to measure wavevector distribution not only from single molecules and single nanostructures but also from metasurfaces and metamaterials. This review provides a birds-eye view on the technique of back focal imaging and spectroscopy, different methodologies used in developing the technique and applications including angular emission patterns of fluorescence and Raman signals from molecules, elastic scattering etc. We first discuss on the information one can obtain at the back focal plane of the objective lens according to both imaging and spectroscopy viewpoints and then discuss the possible configurations utilized to project back focal plane of the objective lens onto the imaging camera or to the spectroscope. We also discuss the possible sources of error in such measurements and possible ways to overcome it and then elucidate the possible applications.},

In this paper we demonstrate that this position and thus the force exerted on the bead can be determined using the backscattered light. Measuring the deflection for a 2.50µm polystyrene bead with both a position sensitive detector ({PSD}) and a quadrant detector ({QD}) we found that the linear detection range for the {PSD} is approximately twice that for the {QD}. In a transmission-based setup no difference was found between both detector types. Using a {PSD} in both setups the linear detection range for 2.50µm beads was found to be approximately 0.50µm in both cases. Finally, for the reflection-based setup, parameters such as deflection sensitivity and linear detection range were considered as a function of bead diameter (in the range of 0.5–2.5µm). 140pN was the largest force obtained using 2.50µm beads.},

While the measurement of translational motion by taking the difference of the backscattered intensity incident on adjacent quadrants of a {QPD} is well known, we demonstrate that rotational motion can be measured very precisely by taking the difference between the diagonal quadrants. The latter measurement eliminates the translational component entirely and leads to a detection sensitivity of around 50 mdeg at S/N of 2 for angular motion of a driven microrod. The technique is also able to resolve the translational and rotational Brownian motion components of the microrod in an unperturbed trap and can be very useful in measuring translation\&\#x2013;rotation coupling of micro-objects induced by hydrodynamic interactions.},

For this, an analytical design approach to flicker-free microtrap movement is devised and cold rubidium atoms are simultaneously rearranged with 2N motional degrees of freedom, representing unprecedented space controllability. We also accomplish an in situ feedback control for single-atom rearrangements with the high success rate of 99\% for up to 10 μm translation.

The third part of the thesis (chapters 6 to 8) studies the interactions between optical traps and nanoparticles in three separate experiments: the optical manipulation of dielectric enhanced semiconductor nanoparticles, heating

Glass is tremendously useful, but it is energy intensive to make because of the high melting temperature and processing methods that require melts. Mader et al. circumvented the need for melting glass using a plastic silica nanocomposite for injection molding (see the Perspective by Dylla-Spears). The low-temperature injection molding can produce parts in as little as 5 seconds with high spatial resolution. The strategy provides a different and potentially less energy-intensive method for mass producing parts made of glass.
Science, this issue p. 182; see also p. 126
Glass is one of the most relevant high-performance materials that has the benefit of a favorable environmental footprint compared with that of other commodity materials. Despite the advantageous properties of glasses, polymers are often favored because they can be processed using scalable industrial replication techniques like injection molding ({IM}). Glasses are generally processed through melting, which is both energy intensive and technologically challenging. We present a process for glassworks using high-throughput {IM} of an amorphous silicon dioxide nanocomposite that combines established process technologies and low-energy sintering. We produce highly transparent glass using classical {IM} and sintering, allowing for a potentially substantial reduction in energy consumption. Our strategy merges polymer and glass processing, with substantial implications for glass utilization.
A plastic, silica-based nanocomposite can be injection molded to quickly make transparent glass parts.

	abstract = {Electrokinetic effects on a.c. field dielectrophoretic and electrotational phenomena have been examined. Asymptotic methods have been used to carry out computations on the net electric force and torque acting on a spherical colloidal particle and its attending electric double layer. The dielectrophoretic force and the electrorotational torque are shown to depend on the real and imaginary parts of the (complex) particle dipole coefficient respectively. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the dipole coefficient that appears in the force and torque expressions is equivalent to that manifested by the particle in a uniform a.c. field. Thus the force and torque calculations reduce to a problem that has been solved previously in connection with dielectric dispersions in colloidal suspensions. The results for aqueous {KCl} solutions indicate that at modest ζ potentials (around 25 {mV}), the dielectrophoretic and electrorotational spectra are influenced strongly by ϵPϵ, the ratio of the particle and solution dielectric constants. At higher ζ potentials (100 {mV}), the spectra of particles with very thin double layers are affected by Stern layer ion transport below forcing frequencies of 1 {MHz}.},

	abstract = {We report a weighing metrology experiment of a single silica microsphere optically trapped and immersed in air. Based on fluctuations about thermal equilibrium, three different mass measurements are investigated, each arising from one of two principle methods. The first method is based on spectral analysis and enables simultaneous extraction of various system parameters. Additionally, the spectral method yields a mass measurement with systematic relative uncertainty of 3.0{\textbackslash}\% in 3{\textasciitilde}s and statistical relative uncertainty of 0.9{\textbackslash}\% across several trapping laser powers. Parameter values learned from the spectral method serve as input, or a calibration step, for the second method based on the equipartition theorem. The equipartition method gives two additional mass measurements with systematic and statistical relative uncertainties slightly larger than the ones obtained in the spectral method, but over a time interval 10 times shorter. Our mass estimates, which are obtained in a scenario of strong environmental coupling, have uncertainties comparable to ones obtained in force-driven metrology experiments with nanospheres in vacuum. Moreover, knowing the microsphere's mass accurately and precisely will enable air-based sensing applications.},

	abstract = {We present limits on sterile neutrino mixing using 4,438 live-days of atmospheric neutrino data from the Super-Kamiokande experiment. We search for fast oscillations driven by an {eV}\${\textasciicircum}2\$-scale mass splitting and for oscillations into sterile neutrinos instead of tau neutrinos at the atmospheric mass splitting. When performing both these searches we assume that the sterile mass splitting is large, allowing \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}2 L/4E)\$ to be approximated as \$0.5\$, and we assume that there is no mixing between electron neutrinos and sterile neutrinos (\${\textbar}U\_\{e4\}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2 = 0\$). No evidence of sterile oscillations is seen and we limit \${\textbar}U\_\{{\textbackslash}mu4\}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\$ to less than 0.041 and \${\textbar}U\_\{{\textbackslash}tau4\}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\$ to less than 0.18 for \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater} 0.8\$ {eV}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ at the 90\% C.L. in a 3+1 framework. The approximations that can be made with atmospheric neutrinos allow these limits to be easily applied to 3+N models, and we provide our results in a generic format to allow comparisons with other sterile neutrino models.},

We demonstrate that the long range, Coulomb-like potential produced by a single blue detuned field increases the collisional cross-section by eight orders of magnitude, allowing fast sympathetic cooling of a trapped nanosphere to {microKelvin} temperatures using cold atoms. By using two optical fields to create a combination of repulsive and attractive potentials, we demonstrate that a cold atom can be bound to a nanosphere creating a new levitated hybrid quantum system suitable for exploring quantum mechanics with massive particles.},

We show how to control the center-of-mass of a large \${\textbackslash}sim500\$nm nanoparticle using the internal state of the atom so as to create, as well as detect, nonclassical motional states of the nanoparticle. Specifically, we consider a setup based on a silica nanoparticle coupled to a Cesium atom and discuss a protocol for preparing and verifying a Schr{\textbackslash}"\{o\}dinger-cat state of the nanoparticle that does no require cooling to the motional ground state. We show that the existence of the superposition can be revealed using the Earth's gravitational field using a method that is insensitive to the most common sources of decoherence and works for any initial state of the nanoparticle.},

The frequency and temperature stability of the nano-oscillator was measured over several days allowing us to identify the major sources of trap and environmental fluctuations. We measure an overall frequency stability of 2 ppm h−1 and a temperature stability of more than 5 h via the Allan deviation. Importantly, we find that the charge on the nanoscillator is stable over a timescale of at least two weeks and that the mass of the oscillator, can be measured with a 3\% uncertainty. This allows us to distinguish between the trapping of a single nanosphere and a nano-dumbbell formed by a cluster of two nanospheres.},
